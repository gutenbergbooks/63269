<p class='ni'>I met Billy Harman on Circular Wharf, Sydney,
so many years ago that I think he must be dead.
He is the chief person in the first six stories of this
book, which have appeared illustrated in an
English, an American and a Canadian magazine,
in all of which the illustrator depicted Billy as
a young, rather good-looking man. That he
was not. Billy, when I met him, was well over
forty, big and scrubby-bearded, a shell-back
with a touch of the Longshoreman, blue far-seeing
eyes, the eyes of a child&mdash;and an innocence
none the less delightful because streaked with
guile.</p>

<p>Only the sea could have produced Billy, and
the Islands and the Beaches and the life which
the Pacific makes possible for an Ocean Tramp.</p>

</h2>

<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>The moon was rising over Papaleete, over the
Pacific Ocean and the bay where the anchor
lights were spilling their amber on the water, over the
palm trees and flame trees and the fragrant town
from which, now clear, now sheltered by the sea wind,
came the voices of girls singing to the tune of Hawaiian
guitars.</p>

<p>Mixed with the breathing of the tepid wind in the
trees, the voices of the girls and the tune of the guitars,
came the murmur and sigh of the beach, the last note
wanted, the last touch, to a scene of absolutely absurd
and impossible loveliness, amidst which, by the water’s
edge, casting a thirty-foot shadow on the hard white
sand, Mr. Harman was walking, blind to the Eden
around him.</p>

<p>Billy was on the beach in more senses than one.
He was down and out, without friends, without food,
without drinks, and almost without tobacco, starving
in the midst of plenty, for in Papaleete, if you are a
cadger, you may live for ever on the fat of the land,
and not only live, but love, drink, smoke, dream
under tree shadows and bathe in a sea warm with
perpetual summer.</p>

<p>But that was not Billy’s way. This gig, four-square,
blue-eyed man out of San Francisco could do
anything but cadge. It wasn’t a question of morals,
it was more a question of simplicity.</p>

<p>Billy’s morals had mostly been forgotten by Nature,
or maybe they had been extracted by San Franciscans
and shore-along toughs from Valparaiso up, anyhow
and however that may be, the resulting vacuum seemed
to have filled itself up with simplicity, not stupidity,
just simplicity. The simplicity of a child that allowed
him to go into the most desperate and questionable
deals in ward politics and doubtful sea practice, wide-eyed,
blue-eyed, and reproaching others for their moral
lapses with the unchanging formula: “It don’t pay.”</p>

<p>“Crooked dealing don’t pay,” said Mr. Harman
after some crooked deal had failed&mdash;never before.</p>

<p>Yet somehow, in some extraordinary way, Billy
was lovable, there was nothing mean about him,
and that was maybe why he couldn’t cadge, and he had
behind those blue eyes and that honest-dog looking,
tanned face, a power of cool, uncalculating daring
that might have landed him anywhere if he had come
on a decent jumping-off place.</p>

<p>As he turned back along the beach, the moonlight
struck a figure coming towards him. It was Davis.
Fate or some strange chance had thrown Davis and
Harman together on the same beach at the same
time, and though there was a world of difference
between their faces, forms, characters and dispositions,
they were alike in this&mdash;they couldn’t cadge.</p>

<p>Davis was a lean slip of a man with a chin tuft
and a terrific past about which he was quite open.
Never satisfied or driven by the craze of adventure,
he had overrun two or three fortunes and had beached
at Papaleete from a B.P. boat which had picked him
up from a trading station down somewhere in the
Paumotus, and was glad to get rid of him on the
terms of a twenty-dollar loan. The captain laughed
when Davis had entered the loan in a pocket-book,
but it would be returned with interest some time
or another if the borrower lived. That was Davis.</p>

<p>The one remarkable thing about this plain-looking
man with the chin tuft and the flat cheek-bones was his
quietude, nothing hurried or flurried him. That was
perhaps the secret behind his shooting. He was more
than a good shot with a revolver. He was inevitable.</p>

<p>“That’s done,” said Davis, coming up with the
other. “Penhill and Jarvis are highballing it at the
club, and their Kanakas are playing hopscotch with
the hula-hula girls. What’s the matter with you?
Don’t go saying you’ve got cold feet.”</p>

<p>“It’s not my feet,” said Mr. Harman, “but I’ve
never run off with a ship before and that’s the fact,
it’s not like sinkin’ her or pilin’ her. I’ve done most
things, but I’ve never run off with a ship before, that’s
a fact. I’ve never&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, close up!” said Davis. “Didn’t I tell you
that Penhill can’t move against us, once I get his
ship out, his feet are cut off. I’m the one man living
that he’s afraid of, because I’m the one man living
that can put him in quod without hurting myself.
This thing isn’t running off with a ship. It’s Providence.”</p>

<p>“How do you get at that?” asked Billy doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, look at it,” said Davis. “In he comes
with the <i>Araya</i>, sees me, remembers the trick he played
me, tries to pal up, gets a snub on the nose, puts it in
his pocket, and then goes on the jag, him and Jarvis,
leaving his schooner with a parcel of damn fool Kanakas
in charge and me layin’ about dangerous. Kanakas,
why they’re worse than that! Island boys that’ll
take any white man’s bidding s’long as he feeds them
with fried bananas. It’s lovely, that’s what it is,
lovely&mdash;&mdash;” Linking his arm in that of Harman, he
was walking him along the sand towards a boat
beached and left almost high and dry by the ebbing
tide. To the right lay the lights of the town, and
almost on the beach sand the long amber glow of the
lit club. Harman, walking between the beauty of
Papaleete by night and the glory of the moon upon
the sea, showed no sign of haste to reach the boat.</p>

<p>What bothered him was, not so much the turpitude
of the business, as the seeming futility and madness
of it, for even in those days before wireless talked
it was next to impossible to steal a ship and make
good. Every port in the world is a compound eye for
scrutiny, the character of a ship is inquired into as
carefully as her health. Harman knew the whole
business. There is a cable from Papaleete to Suva,
and from Suva to ’Frisco and beyond, and to-morrow
morning Penhill had only to speak and the description
of the <i>Araya</i> and the two vanished beachcombers
would be in the hands of the San Francisco authorities
before noon; before night all American seaboard ports
would be closed to the <i>Araya</i>, and by next day at noon,
the British Board of Trade would seal Australia and
Hong Kong. Chinese ports would be notified in
“due course.”</p>

<p>With every bolthole blocked, the <i>Araya</i> might
still live free for years pottering among the less-known
islands, they might even pile her on some rock and
make their escape in the boats, but what would be
the use of all that? No, the whole thing would have
been futile and ridiculous but for the one thing that
made it possible&mdash;Penhill. Penhill daren’t prosecute.
The schooner was his, and he was the only man who
could move, and he was tied. Davis said so. Davis
had given details which made the matter clear to Harman,
yet still he hesitated.</p>

<p>They had reached the boat. It was the <i>Araya’s</i>,
left confidingly on a beach where no man ever stole
boats; there were canoes to be had in plenty, but
Davis preferred the boat, he had reasons.</p>

<p>Harman, resting his hand on the gunnel, looked
about him for a moment at the deserted beach, still
undecided.</p>

<p>His dunnage left at the house of a native woman
where he had lodged was unprocurable, he owed a bill.
As he stood considering this and other matters, from
the groves by the beach diffusing itself through the
night, came the voice of a native singing a love song,
tender, plaintive, old as Papaleete and focussing in
itself all the softness and beauty that the active soul
of Billy Harman had learnt to hate.</p>

<p>He seized the gunnel of the boat and assisted by
Davis, shoved her off.</p>

<p>Out on the moonlit water, the town showed up
fairylike, its lights twinkling amidst the moving
foliage. Away on Huahine, rising steeply like a wall
of velvety blackness to the stars, the lights of tiny
villages showed like fireflies come to rest; fronting
and beneath all this mystery and loveliness showed
the definite amber glow of the club where Penhill and
Jarvis were drinking themselves blind. That was
Papaleete.</p>

<p>No port authorities, no harbour police, no sign of
life but the anchor lights of a brigantine and a bêche-de-mer
boat&mdash;that also was Papaleete. On board the
<i>Araya</i> the anchor watch was snoring; kicked awake
and rubbing its eyes, it jumped to the voice of white
authority. The returned boat was a certificate that
the new white fellow mas’rs were representatives of
white fellow mas’r Penhill and Penhill’s character was
an antidote to loving inquiries.</p>

<p>“They’re a sprightly lot,” said Harman as the
main boom swung to starboard and the great sail
filled, tugging at the sheet. “Monkeys to jump an’
no tongues to ask questions.”</p>

<p>“That’s Penhill,” said Davis, “he’s milled them
into brute beasts, not that they wanted much milling,
but there you are, he done his best and I reckon we’re
profiting by it.”</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>Four days later they had cut Capricorn, discovered
the sailing qualities of the <i>Araya</i>, and taken stock
of ship and cargo. There was also Penhill’s gold
watch and eighteen hundred dollars of ship’s money.
Davis calculated it all up and said he reckoned
that the account between him and Penhill was
clear.</p>

<p>He said he reckoned that Penhill had deserved
what he got and Harman concurred.</p>

<p>They sat in judgment on Penhill and brought him
in guilty. Harman almost felt virtuous.</p>

<p>“I reckon he’ll learn it don’t pay to run crooked,”
said he. “I’ve took notice that them sort of chaps
always gets scragged in the end. What’s this you
said he did you out of?”</p>

<p>“Seventy dollars, and left me on the beach,” replied
Davis.</p>

<p>“Same as we’ve done him,” said Harman. “No, it
don’t pay. It don’t pay no-how.”</p>

<p>South at first, then due west they made past St.
Felix and heading for Caldera on the Chili coast.
But Caldera was not Davis’ objective. Buenodiaz,
with its land-locked harbour, its lazy ways, its pretty
women and negligent Port authorities, was his idea,
and smoking Penhill’s cigars under a blazing sun
whilst the <i>Araya</i> snored along through a Reckitts’-blue
sea, he expounded matters to Billy Harman.</p>

<p>“Sell her on the hoof,” said Davis, “innards,
outwards, hump, tail and all, that’s my idea. There
are ten cent mail boats that’ll take us anywhere up or
down the coast, Valparaiso for choice, once we’ve got
the dollars in our pockets; there’s big things to be
done in Chili with a few dollars by fellows that know
the ropes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harman concurred.</p>

<p>“I’ve been done there myself,” said he, “by chaps
that hadn’t cents in their pockets, let alone dollars.
Skinned alive I was of every buck to my name in a
faro joint at Cubra, and me winning all the time.
Hadn’t got half-way down the street to my ship with
a pocket full of silver dollars when I put my hand in
my pocket and found nothing but stones, filled me up
they had with pebbles off the beach, playin’ guitars
all the time and smokin’ cigarettes and pretendin’
to hasty-manyana.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not against landin’ this hooker on them,
but I tell you, Bud, it’s my experience, before we
comes to close grips with them we’ll be wantin’ to fix
our skins on with seccotine.”</p>

<p>“You leave them to me,” said Bud Davis.</p>

<p>“I’ve known the insides and outsides of Chinks,”
went on the other, “and I’ve had dealin’s with Greeks
up Susun way, oyster boat Levantines will take your
back teeth whiles you’re tellin’ them you don’t want
buyin’ their dud pearls, but these chaps are in their
own class. Jim Satan, that’s what they are, and there’s
not a ’Frisco Jew sellin’ dollar watches can walk round
the brim of their sombreros.”</p>

<p>“You leave them to me,” said Bud, and the <i>Araya</i>
snored on.</p>

<p>On and on with a gentle roll over the wind-speckled
blue of the endless swell, lifting nothing but ocean,
and over ocean vast dawns that turned to torrid noons
and died in sunsets like the blaze of burning worlds;
till one morning the cry of the Kanaka look-out
answered the cry of a great gull flying with them and
there before them stood the coast boiling where the
sun was breaking above it and stretching to north and
south of the sun blaze, solid, remote, in delicately
pencilled hills dying from sight in the blue distance.
Davis, who knew the coast, altered the helm. They
were forty miles or so to the north of their right
position, and it was not till afternoon that the harbour
of Buenodiaz lay before them with the flame trees
showing amidst the flat-topped houses and the blue
water lapping the deserted mole. The quay by the
mole was deserted and La Plazza, the public square,
distinctly to be seen from the sea, lifted slightly as it
was by the upward trend of the ground, was empty.
Through the glass the houses showed, their green
shutters tightly shut and not a soul on the verandas.</p>

<p>It was almost as though some Pelée had erupted
and covered the place with the lava of pure desolation
clear as glass.</p>

<p>“Taking their siestas,” said Davis. “Keep her
as she goes. I know this harbour and it’s all good
holding ground, beyond that buoy.”</p>

<p>Harman at the wheel nodded, and Davis went forward
to superintend the fellows getting the anchor
ready while the <i>Araya</i>, her canvas quivering to the last
of the dying breeze, stole in past an old rusty torpedo
boat, past a grain ship that seemed dead, on and on,
dropping her anchor at least two cable lengths from the
mole.</p>

<p>The rattle of the anchor chain made Buenodiaz
open one eye. A boat slipped out from the mole.
It was the Port Doctor.</p>

<p>Buenodiaz flings its slops into the street and its smells
are traditional, but it has a holy horror of imported
diseases and its Port Doctor never sleeps&mdash;even in
siesta time.</p>

<p>With the Doctor came the Customs, smelling of
garlic, with whom Davis conversed in the language of
the natives, while Harman attended to the liquor and
cigars.</p>

<p>The cargo of the <i>Araya</i> was copra and turtle shell.
Davis had figured and figured over the business, and
reckoned he’d take four thousand dollars for the lot.</p>

<p>“Ain’t like cotton,” said he, “don’t know what it’s
worth, but I’ll put it at four thousand and not a
cent under, at four thousand we shan’t be losers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon we wouldn’t be losers at four cents,”
said Harman, “seein’ how we got it, and how about
the hooker?”</p>

<p>“Five thousand,” said Davis, “and that’s not half
her worth. Nine thousand the lot and I’ll throw the
chronometer in.”</p>

<p>“Have you fixed what to do with the Kanakas?”
asked the other. “There’s eight of them and they’ve
all mouths.”</p>

<p>“There’s never a Kanaka yet could talk Spanish,”
said Davis, “and I don’t propose to learn them, but
I’ll give them fifty dollars apiece&mdash;maybe&mdash;if I make
good. But there’s time enough to think of that when
we have the dollars.”</p>

<p>It was the second day after their arrival at Buenodiaz,
the sun was setting and the sound of the band playing
on La Plazza came across the water; mixed with the
faint strains of the band came the sounds of a guitar
from one of the ships in the anchorage, and in lapses
of the breeze from the sea the scent of the town stole
to them, a bouquet co-mingled from drains, flowers,
garlic, earth and harbour compounds.</p>

<p>Harman was in one of his meditative fits.</p>

<p>“That chap you brought aboard to-day,” said he,
“the big one with the whiskers, was he Alonez or was
it the little ’un?”</p>

<p>“The big one,” said Davis. “He’s the chap
that’ll take the cargo off us and the little one will take
the ship&mdash;I haven’t said a word of the price, haven’t
said I was particularly wanting to sell, but I’ve given
them a smell of the toasted cheese, and if I know
anything of anything, they’re setting on their hind
legs now in some café smoothing their whiskers and
making ready to pounce. They’re partners, they own
all that block of stores on the Calle San Pedro, and the
little one does the shipping business. He’s Portuguese,
pure. Pereira’s his name. I’m going up to his house
to-night to talk business.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harman, “if he’s going to buy, he’s
got the specifications, he’s been over her from the
truck to the lazarette, and I thought he’d be pullin’
the nails out of her to see what they were like. When
are you goin’?”</p>

<p>“Eight,” replied Davis, and at eight o’clock, amidst
the usual illuminations and fireworks with which
Buenodiaz bedecks herself on most nights, he went,
leaving Harman to keep ship. He returned at twelve
o’clock and found Harman in his bunk snoring. At
breakfast next morning he told of his visit. He had
done no business in particular beyond mentioning
the outside price that he could take for the <i>Araya</i>
should he care to sell her. Mrs. Pereira and her
daughter had been there and the girl was a peach.</p>

<p>Harman absorbed this news without interest, merely
reminding the other that they weren’t “dealin’ in
fruit,” but as two more days added themselves together
producing nothing but church processions, brass bands
and fireworks, Mr. Harman fell out of tune with himself
and the world and the ways of this “dam garlic
factory.” Davis was acting strangely, nearly always
ashore and never returning till midnight. He said
the deal was going through, but that it took time,
that they weren’t selling a mustang, that he wouldn’t be
hustled and that Harman, if he didn’t like waiting,
had better go and stick his head in the harbour.</p>

<p>Harman closed up, but that night he accompanied
Davis ashore, and instead of playing roulette at the
little gambling shop in La Plazza, he hung around the
Pereiras’ house in Assumption Street listening and
watching in the moonlight. He heard the tune of a
guitar and a girl’s voice singing La Paloma, then came
a great silence that lasted an hour and a half, and then
came Davis. Hidden in a dark corner, Billy saw that
he was not alone. A girl was with him, come out to
bid him good-night. She was short, dark and lovely,
but the look of adoration on her face as she turned
it up for a kiss, left Harman quite cold.</p>

<p>Down by-lanes and cut-throat alleys he made his
way running, got to the mole before the other and was
rowed off in the same boat. On board he invited the
other down below and down below he exploded.</p>

<p>“I ain’t wantin’ to interfere with any man’s diversions,”
said Mr. Harman. “I ain’t no prude, women is
women, and business is business, do you get what
I’m meanin’? I saw you. I ain’t accusin’ you of
nuthin’&mdash;but bein’ a fool. Us with a stole ship on our
backs and Penhill feelin’ for us and you playin’ the
goat with Pereira’s daughter. What kind of deal do
you expect to make and a woman hangin’ on to it
with her teeth. You needn’t go denyin’ of it. I saw
you.”</p>

<p>The male and female run through all things, even
partnerships, and in the Harman-Davis syndicate it
was Harman who wore the skirts. Davis could not
get a word in till the other had worked himself free
of his indignation and the subject. Then said Davis:
“If you’ll shut your beastly head, I’ll maybe be able
to stuff some sense into it. What were you talking
about, selling the schooner? It’s sold.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harman, “that’s news, and what’s
the price, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Five thousand, and five thousand for the trade,
ten thousand dollars, the whole sum to be paid on
Friday next.”</p>

<p>“Have you a bit of writin’?” asked Harman, who
possessed the French peasant’s instincts for stamped
paper.</p>

<p>“I’ve got their cheque,” said Davis, “post dated
for next Friday, but I’m not bothering about the
money, for the ship and cargo, it doesn’t matter a
hill of beans to me whether they pay ten thousand
dollars or five. I’ve struck a bigger thing than that.
What would you say to half a million dollars?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the ingenuous Harman.
“I only know chaps generally begin to make asses
of themselves when they talk about millions of dollars.
It’s my opinion no man ever came out of the big end
of the horn with the million dollars in his hand he’d
gone in to fetch at the little. Most of the million-dollar
men I’ve heard of have started as newsies with
their toes stickin’ through their boots&mdash;but go on,
what was you sayin’?”</p>

<p>“I’m saying I’ve a big thing in sight,” replied the
exasperated Davis, “and I’d be a lot surer of it if I
felt I hadn’t such a fool partner. It’s this, I’m right
into the cockles of the heart of that family, and I’ve
got the news through my left ear that there’s trouble
in Santiago, that Diaz is going to skip and that a
million dollars in gold bars are coming down to the
coast. Diaz is taking his movables with him, and he’s
gutted the Treasury unknown to the chaps that are
moving to shoot him out. He’s about sick of the
presidency and wants to get away and lead a quiet
life.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Harman. “That’s plain enough, but
where do we stand?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Davis, “there’s a million dollars’
worth of gold bars moving down to the coast here
and there’s us just come in. Don’t it look like Providence?
Don’t it look like as if there’s going to be a
conjunction?”</p>

<p>“It do,” said Mr. Harman meditatively, “but
I’m dashed if I see how we’re to conjunct on the
evidence you’ve handed in&mdash;but you’ve got more up
your sleeve&mdash;pull it out.”</p>

<p>“It’s not much,” said Davis, “only the girl. She’s
going to keep us wise. I told her I might be able to
do a deal with Diaz if I knew where and when he was
shipping off the boodle, and she’s going to let me know.
The Pereiras are all in the business same as furniture-removing
chaps, they’re doing the move for Diaz, and
he’s using one of their ships. D’you see? See where
we come in, nothing to do but watch and wait with
the girl for our eyes and ears&mdash;then pounce&mdash;How?
I don’t know, but we’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“That girl,” said Mr. Harman after a moment’s
silence, “she seems pretty gone on you.”</p>

<p>Davis laughed.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you gone on her?”</p>

<p>Davis laughed again. Then he opened a locker and
helped himself to a drink.</p>

<p>Harman’s morals, as I have hinted before, were the
least conspicuous part of his mental make-up, but he
was not without sentiment of a sort. At sing-songs
he had been known to sniff over “The Blind Boy,” a
favourite song of his, and though his ideal of female
beauty leant towards sloe-black eyes and apple-red
cheeks (shiny or not didn’t matter), beauty in distress
appealed to him.</p>

<p>The cold-blooded blackguardliness of Davis almost
shocked him for a moment&mdash;making a girl love him
like that just to use her as a spy on her family! The
upright man in the soul of Billy Harman, the upright
man who had never yet managed somehow to get on
his feet, humped his back and tried to rise, but he had
half a million dollars on top of him. He moved in
his chair uneasily, and refilled his pipe. But all he
said was: “Tell us about them gold bars.”</p>

<p>Davis told. A peon runner had come in that afternoon
with a chit for Pereira saying that the mules,
eight in number, bearing the stuff, would reach Buenodiaz
by night-time of the following day.</p>

<p>“The stuff will be shipped to-morrow night, then?”
said Harman.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t think they’d go leaving it on the
beach,” replied Davis.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get out of her what ship they were
taking it off on?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“No,” said Davis, “I didn’t, she don’t know herself,
but she’s going to find out.”</p>

<p>“Bud,” said Harman, “give us the straight tip,
I’m not wantin’ to prod into your ‘amoors,’ but how
far have you nobbled her into this business?”</p>

<p>“Well, as you ask me, I’ll tell you,” replied Bud.
“She’s fell into it head first, and up to the heels of her
boots, given me the whole show and location all but
the name of the hooker which she don’t know yet.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say she’s workin’ for you to collar
the stuff?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“But where does she come in?”</p>

<p>“She’s coming with us if we can pull off the deal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” said Harman. “A petticut&mdash;I knew
there must be some fly in the ’intment&mdash;it was too
good to be true. A million dollars rollin’ round
waitin’ to be took and a petticut&mdash;I’ve never known
one that didn’t mess a job it was wrapped up in.”</p>

<p>“It’s a million to one it don’t come off,” said Davis,
removing his boots before turning in, “but there’s
just one chance, and that’s her.”</p>

<p>Next morning Mr. Harman did not go ashore.
He spent his time fishing over the side, fishing and
smoking and dreaming of all sorts of different ways of
spending dollars. Now he was rolling round ’Frisco
in a carriage, and a boiled shirt with a diamond solitaire
in it, calling at the Palatial for drinks. Now he
was in the train of quality eastward bound for N’York,
smoking a big cigar. He did not delude himself that
the deal would come off, but that didn’t matter a bit.
The essence of dreams is unreality. There was a
chance.</p>

<p>Davis went ashore about eleven o’clock, and did
not return till two in the afternoon. When he came
back he was a different man. He seemed younger
and brighter, and even better dressed, though he had
not changed his clothes. Harman, watching him row
up to the ship, noticed the difference in him even before
he came on board.</p>

<p>He swept him down to the cabin, and before letting
him speak, poured out drinks.</p>

<p>“I see it in your mug,” said Harman. “Here,
swaller that before handin’ out the news. Cock
yourself on the bunk side. Well, what’s the odds
now?”</p>

<p>“Twenty to one on,” said Davis, “or a hundred&mdash;it’s
all the same. It’s as good as done. Bo, we got
it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Got it, saddle and bridle an’ pedigree and all.
She’s given it all in and to-night’s the night.”</p>

<p>“Give us the yarn,” said the other.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to it; simple as shop-lifting.
The stuff will be down at the coast here about dark;
it will be taken off soon as it arrives and shipped on
board the <i>Douro</i>. She’s lying over there, and I’ll
point her out to you when we go up. Then, when the
stuff is aboard, she’ll put out, but not till sun up.
They don’t like navigating those outlying reefs in the
dark, moon or no.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Davis, “our little game is to wait till
the stuff is aboard, row off, take the Douro, and push
out with her. You and me and eight Kanakas ought
to do it, there’s no guardship, and the fellows on the
<i>Douro</i> won’t put up much of a fight. You see, they’re
not on the fighting lay; it’s the steal softly business
with them, and I reckon they’ll cave at the first
shout.”</p>

<p>“Where does the girl come in?” asked Billy, after
a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“There’s a place called Coimbra seven mile south
down the coast,” said Davis, fetching a chart from the
locker. “Here it is. That point. I’ve only to
put out a blue light and she’ll put off in a boat.
Pereira’s brother lives down at Coimbra, and she’s
going to-night to stay with him. She’ll be on the
watch out from one on to sunrise, and she’ll easy get
taken out in one of the night fishermen’s boats.”</p>

<p>To all of which Mr. Harman replied, “Damn
petticuts!” He was biting his nails. He was no
feminist. That is to say, he had an inborn conviction
that women tended to spoil shows other than tea
parties and such like. Why couldn’t this rotten girl
have kept out of the business? What did she want
coming along for? Seeing that she was letting down
her people for the love of Davis, it seemed pretty
evident that she was coming along also for the love
of him, but Harman was not in the mood to consider
things from the girl’s point of view.</p>

<p>However, there was no use complaining. With
the chance of a million dollars for nothing, one must
expect a few thorns, so he kept his head closed whilst
Davis, taking him on deck, drew a lightning sketch
of the plan of campaign.</p>

<p>First they had to shift the <i>Araya’s</i> moorings so as
to get closer to the <i>Douro</i>, then they had to put the
Kanakas wise, and more especially Taute the cook and
leader, then they had just to lay low, wait for midnight,
and pounce.</p>

<p>“Righto,” said Mr. Harman, “and if we’re shiftin’
moorin’s, let’s shift now.”</p>

<p>They did, not drawing too noticeably near the
<i>Douro</i>, but near enough to keep watch on her. Near
enough to count the sun-blisters on her side with a
glass. She was of smaller tonnage than the <i>Araya</i>
and ketch-rigged. She had never been a beauty, and
she wasn’t one now; she had no charms to mellow
with age.</p>

<p>Night had fallen on Buenodiaz, and the band on
La Plazza had ceased braying. Eleven o’clock was
striking. Cathedral and churches tinkling and tankling
and clanging the hour; a drunken crew had just
put off for the grain ship lying farther out, and silence
was falling on the scene, when, whizz-bang, off went
the fireworks.</p>

<p>“Damn the place!” cried Harman, whose nerves
were on edge. “It’s clangin’ and prayin’ and stinkin’
all day and closes down only to go off in your face&mdash;some
saint’s day or ’nuther, I expect.”</p>

<p>Davis said nothing. He was watching the blue and
pink of bursting rockets and the fiery, fuzzy worms
reflecting themselves in the harbour.</p>

<p>They had seen several boats stealthily approaching
the <i>Douro</i>. Everything seemed going to time and
the wind was steady.</p>

<p>An hour passed during which Buenodiaz, forgetting
saints and frivolity, fell asleep, leaving the world to
the keeping of the moon.</p>

<p>Convents, churches and cathedral were chiming
midnight when the Kanakas, having crowded into
the boat of the <i>Araya</i>, Davis and Harman got into
the stem sheets and pushed off.</p>

<p>As they drew close, the <i>Douro</i>, with her anchor
light burning, showed no sign of life, bow to the sea
on a taut anchor chain, she rode the flooding tide, she
seemed nodding to them as she pitched gently to the
heave of the swell, and as they rubbed up alongside
and Harman grasped the rail, he saw that the deck was
clear.</p>

<p>“Down below, every man Jack of them,” he whispered
back at Davis. “I can hear ’em snoring.
Foc’s’le hatch first.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the foc’s’le hatch and closed it
gently, turning at a stroke the foc’s’le into a prison.
Then they came to the saloon hatch, stood and listened.</p>

<p>Not a sound.</p>

<p>“They’re all in the foc’s’le,” whispered Harman.
“Just like Spaniards, ain’t it? No time to waste,
we’ve gotta see the stuff’s here; give’s your matches.”
He stepped down, followed by the other, reached the
saloon, and struck a light.</p>

<p>Yes, the stuff was there, a sight enough to turn a
stronger head than Harman’s, boxes and boxes on the
floor and on the couch, evidently just brought on
board and disposed of in a hurry, and all marked with
the magic name: Juan Diaz.</p>

<p>Harman tried to lift one of them. It was not large,
yet he could scarcely stir it. Then with eyes aflame
and hammering hearts, they made up the companion
way, closed the hatch, and, while Davis got the canvas
on her, Harman stood by to knock the shackle off the
anchor chain.</p>

<p>As town and mole and harbour dropped astern,
the <i>Douro</i> close-hauled and steered by Davis, Harman
standing by the steersman, saw the helm going over
and found they were heading north.</p>

<p>“And how about pickin’ up that girl?” asked
Billy, “Coimbra don’t lay this way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon she’ll wait,” replied Davis.</p>

<p>“You’re givin’ her the good-bye?”</p>

<p>“Seems so,” said Davis.</p>

<p>Hannan chuckled. Then he lit a cigar. If girls
chose to fall in love and trust chaps like Davis, it
wasn’t his affair.</p>

<p>At sunrise he slipped down to see after some food.
Davis heard him hammering down below, and knew
that he was sampling the gold, he smiled with the full
knowledge that it was there and that Billy couldn’t
get away with it, when up from the saloon dashed
Billy.</p>

<p>Like a man demented, he rushed forward, opened
the foc’s’le hatch and shouted down it to the imprisoned
Spaniards.</p>

<p>“Come up, you blighters,” cried Mr. Harman.
Then he dived down, found emptiness and returned
on deck.</p>

<p>He held on to the rail as he faced Davis.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand dollars’ worth of trade and ship,”
said Harman, “that’s what we’ve given them for a
stinkin’ ketch and a couple o’ hundred weight of sand.
Sand an’ pebbles that’s what’s in them boxes. You
and your girls! No, you can’t put back, they’d jug
us for stealin’ this bum boat. Take your gruel and
swaller it! Why, bless your livin’ innocence, the
whole of that garlic factory was in it, it’s my belief,
from the Port Doctor up, and they’ll be havin’ fireworks
to-night to celebrate.”</p>

<p>Billy paused, spat into the sea.</p>

<p>“No,” said he, turning his remarks to the universe
in general. “It don’t pay. Runnin’ crooked don’t
pay&mdash;nohow.”</p>

</h2>

<p class='ni'>What would you do were you to find yourself
on a stolen sixty-ton ketch off the middle coast
of Chile with a crew of Kanakas, less than ten
days’ provisions on board, no money to speak of,
and a healthy and lively dread of touching at a Chile
port?</p>

<p>That was the exact position of Mr. William Harman
and his friend, Bud Davis, one bright morning on
board the ketch <i>Douro</i> and thirty miles nor’-west of
Buenodiaz&mdash;about.</p>

<p>The <i>Douro</i> was heading west-nor’-west, the morning
was perfect, the Pacific calm, and Billy, seated on the
hatch cover, was expressing the opinion that running
straight was the best course to adopt in a world where
reefs were frequent and sharks abundant.</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “runnin’ crooked don’t pay, nohow.
There ain’t enough softies about to make it pay, ain’t
enough mugs about, as I’ve told you more’n once.
Happy I was on Papaleete beach and then you comes
along that night and says, ‘Let’s take Penhill’s
ship,’ says you. ‘There she lays, the <i>Araya</i>, sixty-ton
schooner, and he drinkin’ himself blind at the
club and he can’t touch us,’ says you, ‘for he’s mortal
afraid of what I know about him. It’s as safe as
cheeses,’ says you, and off we put and out we took
her&mdash;safe as cheeses, seein’ Penhill couldn’t touch
us, weren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Oh, close up,” said Davis.</p>

<p>“I ain’t rubbin’ it in, I’m just tellin’ you. Nobody
couldn’t touch us, and bold we put into Buenodiaz,
reckonin’ to sell her on the hoof, cargo and all, and
she worth ten thousand dollars if she was worth a bean,
and then what happens? Pereira offers to buy her,
cargo and all, and while you were dickerin’ with
him, his daughter hands you that yarn about the
<i>Douro</i> havin’ a million dollars in bar gold on board of
her, and what does we do?” Mr. Harman’s voice
rose a tone or two. “We leaves ten thousand dollars’
worth of ship and cargo and rows over to this old
tub, boards her, lifts the hook, cracks on sail and puts
out to find nothin’ in them boxes but sand an’ pebbles&mdash;half
a ton of beach, that’s what them darned turkey
bustards had landed on us in swop for a schooner
and cargo worth ten thousand dollars if she was piled,
let alone ridin’ at her moorings in Buenodiaz harbour.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Davis, “you needn’t shout it. You
were in it as well as me. I guess we were both fools,
but we haven’t come off empty-handed&mdash;we’ve got
a ship under our feet, though we’re in a bad way,
I’ll admit. Can’t you see the game that’s been played
on us? This hooker is worth four thousand dollars
any day in the week; they’ve let us run off with her,
they set her as a trap for us, but they’ll want her
back. If we put into any Chile port, we’ll be nabbed
and put to work in the salt mines while these blighters
will get their ship back.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Harman, “but we ain’t goin’ to.”</p>

<p>“How d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“We ain’t goin’ to put into no Chile port.” Davis
sighed, rose, went below and fetched up the top of
one of the gold-boxes, then with a stump of pencil
he drew a rough map of South America, indicating
the appalling coast-line of Chile while the ingenuous
Harman looked on open-mouthed and open-eyed.</p>

<p>“There you are,” said the map-maker, “a hundred
thousand miles long and nothing but seaboard and
there we are&mdash;nothing but the Horn to the south
and Bolivia to the north, and the Bolivians are hand
in fist with the Chilians, and, moreover, there’s sure
to be gunboats out to look for us. That’s why I’m
holding on west. We’ve got to get to sea and trust
in Providence.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the disgusted Harman, “I reckon if
Providence is our stand-by and if it made Chile same’s
your map shows her, we’re done for. There ain’t
no sense in it; no, sir, there ain’t no sense in a country
all foreshore stringed out like that, with scarce room
for a bathin’ machine, and them yellow-bellied Bolivians
at one end of it and the Horn at the other. It
ain’t playin’ it fair on a man, it ain’t more nor less
than a trap, that’s what I call it, it ain’t more nor
less than&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Davis, “wasting your wind.
We’re in it and we’ve got to get out. Now I’ve
just given you our position: we’re running near due
west into open sea, with only ten days’ grub, nothing
to strike but Easter Island and the mail line from
’Frisco to Montevideo. We’ve the chance to pick
up grub from a ship; failing that, either we’ll eat
the Kanakas or the Kanakas will eat us. I’m not
being funny. How do you take it? Shall us hold
on or push down to Valparaiso and take our gruel?”</p>

<p>“What did you say those mines were?” asked
Harman.</p>

<p>“Which mines?”</p>

<p>“Those mines the Chile blighters put chaps like
us to work in.”</p>

<p>“Salt mines.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harman meditated for a moment. “Well,”
said he at last, “I reckon I’ll take my chance on the
Kanakas.”</p>

<p>The <i>Douro</i> had nothing about her of any use for
navigation but the rudder and the compass in the
binnacle and the tell-tale compass fixed in the roof
of the saloon. Pereira, when he had baited her as
a trap for the unfortunates to run away with, had
left nothing of value. He and the beauties working
with him reckoned to get her back, no doubt, as Davis
had indicated, but they knew that the fox sometimes
manages to escape, carrying the trap with him, so
they left nothing to grieve about except the hull,
sticks, strings, canvas, bunk bedding and a few tin
plates and cooking implements.</p>

<p>So she was sailing pretty blind with nothing to
smell at but the North Pole, to use Davis’ words as
he spat over the side at the leaping blue sea, while
Harman, leaning beside him on the rail, concurred.</p>

<p>The one bright spot in the whole position was the
seventeen hundred dollars or so of the <i>Araya’s</i> ship
money still safe in Davis’ pocket.</p>

<p>It proved its worth some six days later when, close
on the San Francisco-Montevideo mail line, they
flagged a big freighter and got provisions enough to
last them for a month, then, “more feeling than
feet under them,” to use Harman’s expression, they
pushed along, protected by the gods of Marco Polo,
and the early navigators, untrusting in a compass
that might be untrustable through blazing days
and nights of stars, smoking&mdash;they had got tobacco
from the freighter&mdash;yarning, lazing and putting their
faith in luck.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said the philosophic Harman, “we
ain’t got no dam chronometer to be slippin’ cogs or
goin’ wrong, nor no glass to be floppin’ about
and frightenin’ a chap’s gizzard out of him with
indications of cyclones and such, nor no charts to be
thumbin’, nor no sextan’ to be squintin’ at the sun
with. I tell you, Bud, I ain’t never felt freer than
this. I reckon it’s the same with money. Come to
think of it, money’s no catch, when all’s said and
done with, what between banks bustin’ and sharks
laying for a chap, not to speak of women and sich,
and sore heads an’ brown tongues in the morning.
Money buys trouble, that’s all I’ve ever seen of it,
and it’s the same all through.”</p>

<p>“Well, that wasn’t your song on the beach at
Papaleete,” said Davis, “and seems to me you weren’t
backward in making a grab for that gold at Buenodiaz.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I wasn’t,” replied the other, and the
conversation wilted while on the tepid wind from the
dark-blue sea came the sound of the bow wash answered
by the lazy creak of block and cordage.</p>

<p>No longer steering west, but northward towards
the line, the <i>Douro</i> brought them nights of more
velvety darkness and more tremendous stars, seas
more impossibly blue, till, one dawn that looked like
a flock of red flamingoes escaping across an horizon
of boiling gold, Bud, on the look-out, cried “Land!”
and the great sun leaping up astern stripped the
curtain away with a laugh and showed them coco-nut
trees beyond a broken sea, and beyond the
coco-nut trees a misty blue stillness incredibly wonderful
and beautiful, till, in a flash, vagueness vanishing,
a great lagoon blazed out, with the gulls circling above
it, gold and rose and marble-flake white.</p>

<p>Before this miracle Harman stood unimpressed.</p>

<p>“We’d have been right into that darned thing
in another hour if the sun hadn’t lifted,” said he,
“unless maybe the noise of the reef would have fended
us off&mdash;hark to it!”</p>

<p>They could hear it coming up against the wind,
a long, low rumble like the sound of a far-off train,
and now, as the <i>Douro</i> drew in, they could see the
foam spouting as the flood tide raced through the
passage broad before them, and showing the vast
harbour of the lagoon.</p>

<p>“The opening seems all right,” said Davis.</p>

<p>“Deep enough to float a battleship,” replied the
other, “and no sign of rocks in it. Shove her in.”</p>

<p>The <i>Douro</i> did not require any shoving. Driven
by the wind and tide she came through the break
like a gull, and as the great lagoon spread before
them they could see the whole vast inner beach with
one sweep of the eye.</p>

<p>It was an oval-shaped atoll, a pond, maybe, four
miles from rim to rim at its broadest part, heavy
here and there with groves of palm and jack-fruit
trees, and showing a village of grass-roofed houses
by the trees on the northern beach, where, on the
blinding white sands, canoes were lying, and from
which a boat was just putting off.</p>

<p>“They’ve sighted us,” said Davis.</p>

<p>“Seems so,” replied Harman, running forward to
superintend the fellows who were getting the anchor
ready, while the <i>Douro</i>, shaking the wind out of her
sails, lost way, and the hook fell in ten-fathom water,
the rumble of the chain coming back in faintest echoes
from the painted shore.</p>

<p>The boat drew on. It was manned by Kanakas
naked as Noah, and steered by a white man. A
huge man with a broad and red and bulbous face,
who came on board leg over rail without a word
of greeting, gazed around him with a pair of protruding
light-blue eyes, and, then, finding his voice,
addressed Harman:</p>

<p>“Where the blazes have <i>you</i> blown in from?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Clayton, for Clayton was his
name, and they were all down below sampling a
bottle of rum wangled by the genius of Harman
out of the purser of the freighter, “Gentlemen, I’m
not divin’ into your business. A ship in ballast
without charts or chronometer, not knowing where
she is, and not willin’ to say where she comes from,
may be on the square and may be not.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t,” said Harman bluntly.</p>

<p>“That bein’ so,” said Clayton, quite unmoved,
“we can deal without circumlocuting round the
show, and get to the point, which is this: I’m wantin’
your ship.”</p>

<p>“Spread yourself,” said Davis, “and tip the
bottle.”</p>

<p>Clayton obeyed.</p>

<p>“I’m willin’ to buy her of you,” said he, “lock,
stock, barrel and Kanakas, no questions asked, no
questions answered, only terms.”</p>

<p>“What’s your terms?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>Clayton raised his head. The wind had shifted,
and, blowing through the open port, it brought with
it a faint, awful, subtle, utterly indescribable perfume.
Far above the vulgar world of stenches, almost
psychic, it floated around them, while Harman spat
and Davis considered the stranger attentively and
anew.</p>

<p>“Oysters,” said Davis.</p>

<p>“Rotting on the outer beach,” said Clayton.
“That’s my meaning and my terms. Gentlemen, if
you ain’t plum’ fools, the smell of them oysters will
be as a leadin’ light to bring you a fortune as big
as my own.”</p>

<p>“Open the can,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Which I will,” replied the other. “I’m straight’s
a gun barrel I am, and I don’t want to beat round
no bushes, and it’s just this way, gents. The hull
of this lagoon is a virgin oyster patch full of virgin
oysters, pearl breedin’ and sound, with no foot-and-mouth
disease to them. Oloong-Javal is the Kanaka
name of the atoll, and it’s on no charts. No, sir, it’s a
sealed lagoon, and I struck it two years ago runnin’
from Sydney to Valparaiso, master of the <i>Sea Hawk</i>,
with a Chink crew and a cargo of chow truck, put
in here for water, spotted the oyster shop, and kept
my head shut. Found orders at Valparaiso to
ballast and get on to Callao, but I didn’t go to no
Callao. I cut loose, fired the mate as a drunk and
incapable, which he was, laid out the ship’s money
on diving dresses and a pump, hawked back here,
landed the equipment, and started in on the pearling.”</p>

<p>“And the Chinks?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“Comin’ to them, they curled up and died of
eating the lagoon fish in the poisonous season, couldn’t
keep them off it&mdash;you know what Chinks are&mdash;and
as for the hooker, why sinkin’ gets rid of a lot of
trouble, and I took her outside the reef and drilled
her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are a one,” said Harman, shocked,
yet intrigued, and vaguely admiring.</p>

<p>“I don’t say that I’m not,” replied Clayton. “I
reckon we’re all in the same boat, and plain speaking
is best among gentlemen, but cuttin’ all that, let’s
get down to tin-tacks. I’ve been working a year
and I haven’t skinned more than a patch of the
beds. All the same, I’ve made my pile, and I want
to enjoy it, I want to have my fun, and if you’re willing
I’ll swap the location and the mining rights for this
hooker and her crew. I want to get home, and
home’s Kisai Island, up north in the Marshalls&mdash;and
that’s what’s waitin’ for me and has been waitin’
for me three years.”</p>

<p>He took a photograph from his pocket and handed
it to the others. It was the photo of a Kanaka girl
under a palm tree on a blazing beach.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, a petticut!” said Harman in a doleful
voice at this sight of ill omen. “A petticut!”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no petticoat about her,” said Clayton&mdash;as
indeed there was not&mdash;“unless the missionaries
have been gettin’ at her with their tomfoolery. Oti
is her name, and there she sits waitin’ for me, which
if she isn’t and has gone and got spliced, I reckon
I’ll bust her husband. Well, gents, which is it to
be for you, floatin’ round loose in this cockroach
trap or a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of pearls
to be took for the working?”</p>

<p>“And how are we to get away supposing we stick
here and pearl?” asked Davis.</p>

<p>“That’s not for me to say,” replied Clayton.
“Something will blow along most likely and take you
off, or you can rig up a canoe and make for the
Paumotus. I’m just offerin’ the deal, which many
a man would jump at, more especial as this old ketch
of yours seems to smell of lost property. I ain’t
insinuating. I’m only hintin’.”</p>

<p>Davis swallowed the suggestion without sign of
taking offence, then he said: “I’ll step on deck with
my friend Harman and have a word with him. I
won’t be more’n five minutes.”</p>

<p>On deck, Harman suddenly clapped himself on
the head. “We’ve left that ballyhoo alone with the
rum-bottle,” said he.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Davis, “we’re better dry.
Now get your nose down to this business while I turn
the handle. First of all we want to get rid of the
ship; second, we want pearls, not for personal adornment,
so to speak, but for profit; third, I believe
the chap’s yarn, and, fourth, I vote we close on his
offer. What you say?”</p>

<p>“I’m with you on the pearls,” said Harman, “and
I’m ready to close on two conditions, and the first is
that the beds haven’t been stripped.”</p>

<p>“We’ll easily prove that,” said Davis. “I’ve done
pearling and I know the business.”</p>

<p>“Second is,” continued Harman, “that havin’
hived the stuff, we’ll be able to get away with it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe what more you’ll be wanting is a mail
boat to ’Frisco and a brass band to play us off. Isn’t
Luck good enough to trust in? And look at the luck
that’s brought us here. What you want flying in
the face of it for?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’re right,” said the other. “The
luck’s all right if it holds; question is, will it? I
don’t like that petticut flyin’ up in our face; it’s
part of the deal, seems to me, since he’s droppin’ this
place mainly to get to her, and I’ve never seen a deal
yet that wasn’t crabbed if a woman put as much as
the tip of her nose into it. I ain’t superstitious. I’m
only sayin’ what I know, and all I’m saying is that it’s
rum him talking of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said the other, “you’re worse than
any old woman. I’m into this business whether or
no, and you can stay out if you want. How’s it to
be?”</p>

<p>Harman raised his head and sniffed the air tainted
with the oysters rotting on the coral. Then he turned
to the cabin hatch. “Come on,” said he, and they
went below to close the bargain.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Clayton’s house was grass-thatched like the others
and situated close to the groves on the right of the
village; it had three rooms and a veranda, and mats
and native-made chairs constituted the chief furniture.
Beyond the house, farther on the right, was the shed
where a few trade goods, mostly boxes of tobacco and
rolls of print, were stored.</p>

<p>“That’s all there’s left of the stuff I brought with
me,” said he; “it’ll carry you on, and I make you a
present of it. The Kanakas aren’t used to high wages.
A chap will dive all day for the fun of it and half a
stick of tobacco, but you can do most of the diving
yourselves and save on the business. There are the
diving suits, two of them. Good as when I got them,
and the pump’s in the boat there; she’s in that canoe
house, it’s a Clarkson, in good order. Say, boys, you’ve
no reason to sneeze over this deal. Here’s an island,
a living larder, pigs and fowl and taro and fish and
fruit for nix, a pearl lagoon not half worked, diving
suits and pump and a bit of trade, and all for that
frousty old brown boat of yours. Was you ever on
your feet before?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe,” said Davis, “we’ve no call to
complain if the beds are all right. Let’s put out and
look at them.”</p>

<p>They took the <i>Douro’s</i> boat and rowed out, Clayton
steering and piloting them.</p>

<p>The beds ran north, acres of them, and one of the
Kanakas Clayton had taken with them dived now and
then and brought up a pair of shells as a sample.</p>

<p>Big molluscs they were, weighing maybe eight
hundred to the ton, of the white shell like the Tahiti
oysters.</p>

<p>Davis, who knew something of the business, reckoned
that the shell alone was worth five hundred dollars
a ton, but he said nothing as the boat, impelled by the
sculls, passed through the crystal water.</p>

<p>Every lagoon would be a pearl lagoon but for the
fact that the oyster of all sea creatures is the most
difficult to suit with a breeding ground. The tides
must not be too swift, the floor must be exactly right.</p>

<p>Javal Lagoon was ideal, a bar of reef delaying the
floor current and the coral showing the long coach-whip
fucus loved by the pearl-seeker. Davis declared
himself satisfied, and they rowed back to inspect
the mounds of shell and oysters rotting on the beach
which were to be thrown in as part of the goodwill
of the business.</p>

<p>That night after supper, Clayton showed his pearls.
A few of them. He had four tin cash-boxes, and he
opened one and disclosed his treasures lying between
layers of cotton-wool. You have seen chocolate
creams in boxes&mdash;that was the sight that greeted the
eyes of Harman and Davis, only the chocolate creams
were pearls. Some were the size of marrowfat peas
and some were the size of butter beans, very large,
but not of very good shape, some were pure white,
some gold and some rose.</p>

<p>“Don’t show us no more, or I guess we’ll be robbin’
you,” said Harman.</p>

<p>Next morning the pearl-man began his preparations
for departure, the water-casks of the <i>Douro</i> were
filled, chickens caught and cooped, a live pig embarked
and the groves raided for nuts, bananas and bread-fruit.</p>

<p>“It’s well he’s leavin’ us the trees,” said Harman.</p>

<p>The diving suits were got out and Clayton showed
them how they were used, also the trick of filling the
net bag with oysters in the swiftest way and without
tangling the air-tube. The beds were shallow enough
to be worked without diving gear, but a man in a
diving dress will raise five times as many pairs of shells
as a man without in a given time, Clayton explained
this. He left nothing wanting in the way of explanations
and advice, and next morning, having filled up
with provisions and water, he put out, taking the ebb,
the <i>Douro</i> heeling to a five-knot breeze and followed
past the break by a clanging escort of gulls.</p>

<p>Then Harman and Davis found themselves alone,
all alone, masters of a treasure that would have
turned the head of Tiffany, and of a hundred and fifty
Kanakas, men, women, and children, a tribe captained
and led by one Hoka, a frizzy-headed buck whose
only dress and adornment was a gee string and the
handle of a china utensil slung round his neck as a
pendant.</p>

<p>The rotted oysters on the coral were useless, they
had been worked over by Clayton. That was the
first surprise, the next was the price of labour. Two
sticks of tobacco a day was the price of native labour,
not half a stick as reported by Clayton.</p>

<p>Trade tobacco just then worked out at two cents a
stick, so the pay was not exorbitant; it was the smallness
of the stock in hand that bothered our syndicate.
But Hoka was adamant. He did not know ten words
of English, but he knew enough to enforce his claims,
and the syndicate had to give in.</p>

<p>“I knew there’d be flies in the ’intment somewhere,”
said Harman, “but this is a bluebottle. We haven’t
tobacco enough to work this lagoon a month, and what’s
to happen then?”</p>

<p>“No use bothering a month ahead,” replied Davis.
“If worst comes to the worst, we’ll just have to do
the diving ourselves. Get into your harness and down
with you, to see how it works.”</p>

<p>Harman did, and an appalling rush of bubbles
followed his descent, the suit was faulty. Tropical
weather does not improve diving suits, and Harman
was just got up in time.</p>

<p>“Never again,” said he when his window was unscrewed,
and he had done cursing Clayton, Clayton’s
belongings, his family, his relatives and his ancestors.</p>

<p>“Stick her on the beach; darn divin’ suits, let’s
take to the water natural.”</p>

<p>They did, following the practice of the Kanakas,
and at the end of the week, when the shells were rotted
out, six days’ takings showed three large pearls perfect
in every point and worth maybe fifteen hundred
dollars, five small pearls varying in value from ten to
forty dollars according to Davis’ calculations, several
baroques of small and uncertain value and a spoonful
of seeds.</p>

<p>“Call it two thousand dollars,” said Davis, when
they had put the takings away in some cotton-wool,
left by Clayton, and a small soap-box. “Call it two
thousand and we’ve had twenty Kanakas diving for
a week at two sticks a day, that makes two hundred
and eighty sticks at two cents a stick.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s cheap enough,” said Harman. “Wonder
what the unions would say to us and them chaps that’s
always spoutin’ about the wages of the workin’ classes&mdash;not
that I’m against fair wages. I reckon if that
guy Clayton had left us enough tobacco, I wouldn’t
mind raisin’ the wage bill to eight dollars a week, but
we haven’t got it&mdash;haven’t got enough to last a month
as it’s runnin’ now.”</p>

<p>He spoke the truth. Less than a month left them
cleared out, and the Kanakas struck to a man and
ceased to dive, spending their time fishing, lazing in
the sun and smoking&mdash;but their chief amusement was
watching the white men at work.</p>

<p>There is no penitentiary equal to a pearl lagoon,
once it seizes you, and no galley slaves under the
whip ever worked harder than Harman and Bud Davis,
stripped to the skin, brown as cobnuts with sun and
water, long-haired, dishevelled, diving like otters,
and bringing up not more than a hundred pair of shells
a day.</p>

<p>The boat had to be anchored over a certain spot,
and as the work went on the anchorage had to be
shifted; at the end of the day the oysters had to be
brought ashore and laid out on the coral to rot. Then,
too tired, almost, to smoke, the Pearl Syndicate would
stretch itself under the stars to dream of fortune
and the various ways of spending money.</p>

<p>The imaginative Harman had quite definite views
on that business&mdash;diamonds and dollar Henry Clays,
champagne and palatial bars, standing drinks to all
and sundry and a high time generally, that was his
idea. Davis, darker and more secretive, had higher
ambitions roughly formulated in the words, “More
money.” Dollars breed dollars, and great wealth
was enough for him. He would spend his money on
making more, sure in his mind that if he once got his
foot again in ’Frisco with a pocketful of money, he
would find his way out through the big end of the
horn.</p>

<p>And so they went on till at the end of four months,
taking stock of their possessions, they found themselves
forty thousand dollars up, to use Davis’ words.</p>

<p>Taken by the hands of the Kanakas in the first
month and by their own hands in the three succeeding
months, they had safely hived forty-seven white and
perfect pearls, two golden pearls, one defective, some
red pearls not worth more than a shilling a grain, and,
king of the collection, a great black pearl pear-shaped
and perfect and equal to any Mexican in lustre and
value. There were also some baroques of extraordinary
shapes and a quantity of seeds.</p>

<p>Of the forty-seven white pearls, four were of very
large size. Davis had no scales, but he reckoned that
these four and the black were worth all the rest put
together.</p>

<p>The general stock-taking brought an end to their
luck, and for weeks after the take was a joke, to use
Davis’ expression. It is always so in pearling; a
man may make a small fortune out of a fishery in a
few months, but the take is never consistent, and if
he strikes it rich at first, it is ten to one he will have to
pay for his luck.</p>

<p>One morning, just as the sun was freeing himself
from the reef and the last of the gulls departing for
their deep-sea fishing grounds, Harman, who had been
to draw water from the well, suddenly dropped the
bucket he was carrying, shaded his eyes and gave a
shout that brought Davis from the house.</p>

<p>Davis looked to where the other was pointing, and
there far off to the north and lit by the newly-risen
sun stood a sail.</p>

<p>They had been praying for a ship for the last fortnight,
speculating on the chances of anything picking
them up before they died of hope deferred and loneliness
and a diet of fish and vegetable truck, yet now,
before that sail hard on the blue and evidently making
towards them, they scarcely felt surprised, and were
too troubled to be filled with joy; for it suddenly
occurred to them that pearls were pearls&mdash;that is to
say, wealth in its most liftable form.</p>

<p>“Say, Bud,” cried Harman, “we’ve got to hide
them divin’ dresses. If these chaps ain’t on the
straight and they sniff pearls, we’ll be robbed sure
and shoved in the lagoon. I never thought of that
before. We’re sure marks for every tough till we’ve
cashed in and banked the money.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t far wrong,” replied Davis, still contemplating
the sail. “Yes, she’s making for here,
and she’s all a hundred and fifty tons. Inside two
hours she’ll be off the reef and we’ve no time to waste.”</p>

<p>Most of the island Kanakas had gone fishing the
night before to the other side of the atoll, so there were
only a few old women and children about to mark the
actions of the Pearl Syndicate.</p>

<p>First they dealt with the boat that held the pump,
sinking it by the inner beach in four-fathom water at a
point where the trees came down right across the sands.</p>

<p>Then, carrying the diving suits, they dumped them
in a fish-pool off the outer beach. Having done this,
they divided the pearls, making two parcels of them,
and surprisingly small parcels they were considering
their value.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Harman, when all was done, “we’re
shipwrecked chaps blown ashore, we don’t know
nothing about pearls, and we reckon the house and go-down
were built by some trader the Kanakas has
murdered. How’s that for a yarn to sling them;
but what’s the name of our ship?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Mary Ann Smithers</i>,” replied Davis promptly,
“from Tampico to ’Frisco, cargo of hides and wool,
badly battered off the Horn, old man’s name Sellers,
and driven out of our course by the big gale a month
ago. There wasn’t any gale a month ago, but it’s a
million to one they were a thousand miles off then,
so how are they to know?”</p>

<p>“You were second officer,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“No, I was bo’sun; second officers are supposed to
be in the know of the navigation and all such. I
was just bo’sun, plain Jim Davis.”</p>

<p>“Well, they won’t dispute you’re plain enough,”
said Harman. “But you ain’t the cut of a bo’sun,
not to my mind, cable length nearer you are to the look
of a Methodis’ preacher or a card sharp&mdash;no need to
get riled&mdash;be a bo’sun and be darned, be anythin’
you like. I’m an A.B. hopsacker, British born and&mdash;here
they are.” The fore canvas of the schooner was
just showing at the break.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>She came in laying the water behind her as though
she had a hundred square miles of harbour to manœuvre
in, then the wind shivered out of her canvas
and almost on the splash of the anchor a boat was
dropped.</p>

<p>Harman and Davis watched it as it came ashore,
noted the stroke of the broad-backed Kanaka rowers
and the sun helmet of the white man in the stern and
his face under the helmet as he stepped clear of the
water on to the beach.</p>

<p>Mandelbaum was the name of the newcomer, a
dark, small man with a face expressionless as a wedge
of ice. He wore glasses.</p>

<p>As he stepped on to the sand he looked about him
in seeming astonishment, first at Harman, then at
Davis, then at the house, then at the beach.</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Same to yourself,” replied Harman, “we’re derelicks.
Hooker bust herself on the reef in a big blow
more’n a month ago. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Mandelbaum,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Well, come up on the verandy and have a drink,”
said the hospitable Harman, “and we can have a
clack before goin’ aboard. You the captain of that
hooker?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Mandelbaum.</p>

<p>“Then I reckon you won’t mind givin’ us a lift.
We’re not above workin’ for our grub&mdash;set down till
I get some drinkin’ nuts.”</p>

<p>There was a long seat under the veranda, the house
door was at the westward end of the house and the
seat ran from the door to the eastern end. It was long
enough for, maybe, ten people to sit on comfortably,
and the three sat down on the seat. Harman having
fetched the nuts, Mandelbaum threw his right leg
over his left knee and turning comfortably and in a
lazy manner towards the others, said:</p>

<p>“Where’s Clayton?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Harman.</p>

<p>Davis said nothing. His mouth fell open, and
before he could shut it Mandelbaum got in again.</p>

<p>“Don’t go to the trouble of trying any monkey tricks,
there’s half a dozen fellows with Winchesters on that
schooner. Your bluff is called. Where’s Clayton,
my partner? He and a year’s taking of pearls ought
to be here. I bring the schooner back with more
trade goods and he’s gone, and I find you two scowbarkers
in his house and serving strangers with your
damn drinking nuts.” A venomous tang was coming
into the steady voice, and a long slick Navy revolver
came out of his left-hand coat pocket into his right
hand, with the nozzle resting on his right knee.</p>

<p>“Where’s Clayton, dead&mdash;but where, where have
you planted him, and where have you cached the
pearls?”</p>

<p>“Cached the pearls?” suddenly cried Harman,
finding his voice and taking in the whole situation.
Then he began to laugh. He laughed as though
he were watching Charlie Chaplin or something
equally funny. He was. The picture of Clayton
stood before him. Clayton making off with his partner’s
share of the pearls, and handing the island and the
fishing rights to him and Davis in return for the ketch,
the picture of Davis and himself working like galley
slaves, doing four months’ hard labour for the sake
of Mandelbaum, for well he knew Mandelbaum would
make them stump up to the last baroque.</p>

<p>Then he sat with his chin on his fists, spitting on
the ground, while Davis explained and Harman
soliloquised sometimes quite out aloud: “No, it
ain’t no use; straight’s the only word in the dictionary.
No darn use at all, ain’t enough mugs&mdash;and
a petticut on top of all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>“Well, what’s the ‘ultermatum’?” asked Harman,
a day later, as he stood by a native canoe on the beach.</p>

<p>“It’s either stick here and work for two dollars a
day or get out for the Paumotus,” replied Davis,
coming up from a last interview with Mandelbaum.
“Which will we do, stick here and work for Mandelbaum
for two dollars a day sure money, house, grub
and everything found, or put out for the Paumotus
in this blessed canoe which his royal highness says we
can have in exchange for the ship’s money he’s robbed
us of? Which is it to be, the society of Mandelbaum
or the Paumotus, which is hell, sharks, tide races,
contr’y winds and starvation, maybe?”</p>

<p>“The Paumotus,” said Harman without a moment’s
hesitation.</p>

<p class='ni'>Have you ever tried to manage a South Sea canoe,
a thing not much wider than a skiff, with mast
and sail out of all proportion to the beam, yet made
possible because of the outrigger?</p>

<p>The outrigger, a long skate-shaped piece of wood,
is supposed to stabilize the affair; it is always fixed
to port and is connected to the canoe proper in two
chief ways, either by a pole fore and aft or by a central
bridge of six curved lengths of wood to which the mast
stays are fixed; there are subsidiary forms with three
outrigger poles, with two outrigger poles and a bridge,
but it was in a canoe of the pure bridge type that Bud
Davis and William Harman found themselves afloat
in the Pacific, making west with an unreliable compass,
a dozen and a half drinking nuts, a breaker of water
and food for a fortnight.</p>

<p>They had been shot out of a pearl lagoon by the
rightful owner and robbed of two double handfuls of
pearls which they had collected in his absence. Given
the offer of a canoe to go to the devil in or honest
work at two dollars a day with board and lodging free,
they had chosen the canoe.</p>

<p>They could work; they had worked like beavers
for months and months collecting those pearls, but
they weren’t going to work for wages.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Harman, “I ain’t come down to
that yet. Billy Harman’s done signin’ on to be sweated
like a gun-mule and hove in the harbour when he’s
old bones; the beach is good enough for him if it comes
to bed-rock.”</p>

<p>It had certainly come to bed-rock now this glorious
morning, two days out and steering into the face of
the purple west, the great sun behind them just risen
and leaning his chin on the sea line.</p>

<p>Harman was at the steering paddle, Davis forward.
They had breakfasted on cold water and bananas, and
Billy was explaining to Davis exactly the sort of
fools they had been, not in refusing work and good
grub and pay, but in having failed to scrag Mandelbaum,
the pearl man.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Davis, “you’re always going
back on things, and you haven’t it in you to scrag
a chicken, anyhow; always serving out that parson’s
dope about it not paying to run crooked.”</p>

<p>“Nor it don’t,” said the moralist. “There ain’t
enough mugs in the world, as I’ve told you more than
twice. I don’t say there ain’t enough, but they’re too
spread about&mdash;now if you could get them all congeriated
into one place, I wouldn’t be behind you in
waltzing in with a clear conscience an’ takin’ their
hides&mdash;but there ain’t such a place&mdash;&mdash; ’Nother thing
that queers the pitch is the way sharps let on to be
mugs. Look at Clayton.”</p>

<p>“What about Clayton?”</p>

<p>“Well, look at him. In we sails to that pearl shop
and there we finds him on the beach. Looked like
the king of the mugs, didn’t he, with his big, round
face and them blue-gooseberry eyes. ‘Here’s a sealed
lagoon for you,’ says he, ‘I’m done with it; got all
the pearls I want and am only wishful to get away;
take it for nix, I only want your ship in exchange,
and we fall to the deal and off he goes.’</p>

<p>“We didn’t know he’d sailed off with all his pardner’s
pearls, did we? And when his pardner, Mandelbaum,
turns up and collars our takin’s, and kicks us out in
this durned canoe after we’d been workin’ months
and months, our pitch wasn’t queered&mdash;was it? And
all by a sharp got up to look like a sucker and be d&mdash;&mdash;d
to him. Well, I hopes he’ll fry in blazes if he ain’t
drowned before he cashes them pearls. I ain’t given
to cursin’, but I could curse a hole in this dished canoe
when I thinks of the hand we give him by fallin’ into
his trap and the trick he served us by settin’ it.”</p>

<p>“MIND!” yelled Davis.</p>

<p>Harman, in his mental upset, had neglected his
steering, and the canoe paying off before the wind
nearly flogged the mast out as Davis let go the sheet.</p>

<p>There are two sure ways of capsizing a South Sea
canoe&mdash;letting the outrigger run under too deep and
letting it tip into the air. They nearly upset her both
ways before matters were righted, then pursuing
again the path of the flying fish, the little canoe retook
the wind, tepid and sea-scented and blowing out of
the blue north-west.</p>

<p>An hour after sunrise next morning Davis, on the
look-out, saw a golden point in the sky away to the
south of west. It was the cloud turban of Motul.
A moment later Harman saw it too.</p>

<p>“Lord! it’s a high island,” cried he. “I thought
there was nuthin’ but low islands in these parts. Where
have we been driftin’ to?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Davis. “Mind your
steering, it’s land, that’s all I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t grumblin’,” said Harman. He got
her a point closer to the wind and steered, keeping
the far-off speck on the port bow. The breeze freshened
and the stays of the mast, fastened to the outrigger
grating, twanged while the spray came inboard now
and then in dashes from the humps of the swell, yet
not a white cap was to be seen in all the vast expanse
of water, the great sea running with a heave in the
line of Humboldt’s current from south to north, but
without a foam gout to break the ruffled blue.</p>

<p>At noon Motul had lost its turban of cloud, but
now it stood, a great lumping island moulded out of
mountains, scarred with gulleys down which burst
forests and rainbow falls, for Motul was green with the
recent rains and its perfume met them ten miles across
the sea.</p>

<p>There seemed no encircling reef, just a line of reef
here and there, beyond which lay topaz and aquamarine
sheets of water bathing the feet of the great black
cliffs of Motul.</p>

<p>“Ain’t a place I’d choose for a lee shore,” said
Billy, “but this canoe don’t draw more than a
piedish, and I reckon we can get her in most anywhere
across the reefs. Question is where do them cliffs
break?”</p>

<p>They kept a bit more to the south, and there sure
enough was the big break where the cliffs seem smashed
with an axe and where the deep water comes in,
piercing the land so that you might anchor a battleship
so close that the wild cliff-hanging convolvulus could
brush its truck and fighting tops.</p>

<p>“We can’t make it before dark,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Don’t matter,” said Davis.</p>

<p>It didn’t; although the moon had not risen, the
stars lit Motul and the great dark harbour that pierces
the land like a sword.</p>

<p>The breeze had almost fallen dead as they came in,
nothing but the sea spoke, breaking on the rocks and
lipping up the cliffs, where screw pines clung and the
great datura trumpets blew in the silver light.</p>

<p>Then as they stole across the water of the harbour,
the dying breeze laying glittering fans before them,
they saw, right ahead on the shore where the dark
cliffs drew away, lights twinkling and dancing like
fireflies, lights standing and moveless, lights crawling
like glowworms. It was Amaho, the chief village of
Motul, and the lights were the lights of the houses,
the fish spearers, the lovers and the wayfarers of the
chief town of Paradise.</p>

<p>For Motul is Paradise in all things that relate to the
senses of sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch, and its
people are part of their environment. Here there
are no ugly women and few old people, here bathing
is perpetual as summer, and summer is never oppressive.
Here everything grows that is of any use
in the tropics.</p>

<p>The pineapples of Motul are as white inside as sawn
deal, yet you can almost eat them with a spoon, and
their flavour beats that of the Brazilian pineapple,
the English hothouse and the pine of Bourbon; they
have fig bananas with a delicate golden stripe unobtainable
elsewhere, and passion fruit with a vanilla
flavour only to be found at Motul.</p>

<p>Also there are girls.</p>

<p>Harman and his companion, faced with the lights
of the town, determined not to land till morning.
They dropped their stone killick in six-fathom water,
ate the last of their bananas, turned on their sides and
fell asleep to be awakened by the dawn, a dawn of
many colours standing against the far horizon on a
carpet of rose and fire. Then, all of a sudden, tripping
across the sea, she pulled up a curtain and the sun hit
Amaho, the bay, the beach, and the anchored canoes,
including the stranger canoe that had arrived during
the night.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Harman, “they’ve spotted us.” He
pointed to the beach, where a crowd was gathering, a
crowd with faces all turned seaward. Children were
running along the sands, calling their elders out of
houses to come and look, and now heads of swimmers
began to dot the water and girls with flowers in their
dark hair came towards the canoe, swimming with the
effortless ease of fish; girls, young men, and boys,
the whole population of Amaho seemed to have taken
to the sea, and with them Davis held converse in broken
<i>bêche de mer</i>, while Harman gloomily considered the
“skirts.”</p>

<p>I think Harman’s dislike of womenfolk had less
to do with misogyny pure and simple than with a
feeling, born from experience, that women tend to
crab deals and interfere with the progress of prosperity,
just as it is coming along to you by devious, not to say
crooked paths.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the way of any possible deal
looming before them this morning. All the same,
the ingenuous Harman did not relax or unbend in
the least before this vision of friendly mermaids, one
of whom was boldly now grasping the starboard gunnel
with a wet hand while another, to port, was engaged
in putting a leg over the outrigger.</p>

<p>“They’re a friendly lot,” said Davis over his shoulder
to the other. “Ain’t much to be done here as far as
I can see, no shell nor turtle, and they’re too lazy to
make copra, but it’s a good place to rest in and refit.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a good place to drown in if that piece don’t
get off the outrigger,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your opinion, shall we shove her in?”</p>

<p>“Aye, shove her in,” said Harman, and, getting
up the anchor, they took to the paddles, making for
the beach with an escort of swimmers ahead, to port,
to starboard and astern.</p>

<p>It was the girl on the outrigger that did the business,
a wild-eyed, elfish-looking, yet beautiful individual,
divorced from the humdrum civilized scheme of things
as Pan or Puck. She only wanted horns and a little
fur trimming or a small addition of wings to have done
for either.</p>

<p>As it was, she nearly did for Mr. Harman. In some
miraculous way an affinity exhibited itself between
these two, an attraction drew one towards the other,
so that at the end of a week if you had seen Billy
anywhere about by himself, sitting on the beach or
lying in the shade of the trees, you would ten to
one have found Kinie&mdash;that was her name&mdash;not far off.</p>

<p>She had attached herself like a dog to the man,
and Billy after a while, and towards the end of the
first week, found himself drifting far from his old
moorings.</p>

<p>He and Davis had built themselves a house in forty-eight
hours and food was on every hand; they had
no cares or worries, no taxes, eternal summer and the
best fishing south of California, bathing, boating, yet
they were not happy; at least, Davis was not.</p>

<p>Civilization, like savagery, breeds hunters, and your
hunter is not happy when he is idle; there was nothing
to be shot at here in the way of money, so Davis
was not happy. Harman, dead to the beauty around
him, might have shared the discontent of the other,
only for Kinie. She gave him something to think
about.</p>

<p>Drowsing one day under a bread-fruit tree, a squashy
fruit like a custard apple fell on his head, and, looking
up, he saw Kinie among the leaves looking down at
him. Next moment she was gone. Bread-fruit trees
don’t grow apples like that; she must have carried
it there to drop it on him, a fact which, having bored
itself into Mr. Harman’s intelligence, produced a
certain complacency. He had been in her thoughts.</p>

<p>An hour or two later, sitting by the edge of the beach,
she came and sat near him, dumb and stringing coloured
pieces of coral together&mdash;anything coloured seemed
to fascinate her&mdash;and there they sat, saying nothing,
but seemingly content till Davis hove in sight and
Kinie, gathering up her treasures, scampered off.</p>

<p>“You and that gal seem mighty thick,” said Davis.
“Blest if you aren’t a contradiction, always grumbling
about petticoats and saying they bring you bad luck,
and set you ashore&mdash;and look at you.”</p>

<p>“I give you to understand, Bud Davis, I won’t
be called no names, not by no man,” replied the other.
“It ain’t my fault if the girl comes round and there
ain’t no harm in her comin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve picked the prettiest of the lot, anyhow,”
said Davis. “Don’t go telling me, girls are
girls and men are men; but we’ll leave it there. It’s
no affair of mine. <i>I’m</i> not grumbling.”</p>

<p>On he walked, leaving the outraged Harman on
the sands, speechless because unable to explain, unable
to explain even to himself the something between
himself and the wildly beautiful, charming, yet not-quite-there
Kinie.</p>

<p>The fascination he exercised upon her would have
been even more difficult to explain. Davis was younger
and better-looking. Davis had made advances to her
which Harman had never done, yet she avoided Davis,
never dropped custard apples on his head or sat by
him stringing bits of coral or followed him at a distance
through the woods.</p>

<p>Nor did she ever try to steal Davis’ pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>Harman possessed a blazing parti-coloured bandana
handkerchief. It was silk, and had cost him half a
dollar at Mixon’s at the foot of Third Street, which
adjoins Long Wharf. It was his main possession.
He used it not as handkerchiefs are used, but as an
adjunct to conversation as your old French marquis
used his snuff-box. Stumped for words or in perplexity,
out would come the handkerchief to be mopped
across his brow.</p>

<p>Kinie from the first had been fascinated by this
handkerchief. She wanted it. One day he lost it,
and an hour later she flashed across his vision with it
bound around her head. He chased her, recaptured
it, reduced her to sulks for twenty-four hours, and a
few days later she boldly tried to steal it again. Then
she seemed to forget all about it; but do women ever
forget?</p>

<p>One morning some two months after they had landed,
Davis, coming out of the house, found the beach in
turmoil. Girls were shading their eyes towards the
sea, and young fellows getting canoes in order for
launching, while children raced along the sands screaming
the news or stood fascinated like the girls, and, like
them, gazing far to sea.</p>

<p>A ship had been sighted, and there she was on the
far-rippled blue, the tepid wind blowing her to life
and growth, the sun lighting her sails and turning
them to a single triangular pearl.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more beautiful than the far ship
on the far sea with the near sea all broken to flashing
sapphire, the whole picture framed between the verdurous
cliffs of the harbour entrance and lit by the
entrancing light of morning.</p>

<p>But Davis had no eye for the beauty of the picture,
he turned, ran back to the house, and fetched out
Harman.</p>

<p>“Fore and aft rig, maybe eighty or a hundred ton,
maybe a bit less,” said Harman, “makin’ dead for
the beach. Say, Bud, we been fools. Here’s a ship
and never a plan to meet her with, nor a story to tell
her.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the odds?” said Davis. “We’re
shipwrecked, or, if you like it better, we skipped from
a whaler. What are you bothering about? We’ve
nothing to hide, only the <i>Douro</i>, and we’ve got rid
of her. You’ve never thought of that, B. H. You’ve
always been going on about Clayton getting the better
of us by skipping off with those pearls in exchange
for the <i>Douro</i>; hasn’t it ever got into your thick
head that since we as good as stole the hooker, he did
us a good turn by taking her? There’s not a port
he could bring her into without being had, and I’ll
bet my back teeth he’s jugged by this, him and his
pearls.”</p>

<p>“If he is,” said Harman, “I’ll never say a word
against the law again.”</p>

<p>Then they hung silent and the ship grew. The wind
held steady, then it faded, great smoke-blue spaces
showing on the sea; then it freshened, blowing from
a new quarter, and the stranger, shifting her helm,
payed off on the starboard tack. She showed now to
be ketch-rigged.</p>

<p>“I’ve always been agin’ the law,” went on Mr.
Harman, “but if the law puts that blighter in chokee,
I’ll take the first lawyer I meet by the fist. I will so.
I’ll say to him, you’re a man an’ brother, law or no
law.”</p>

<p>“Oh hang the law!” cried Davis, whose face had
turned purple, and whose eyes were straining at the
ship. “Look at her. Can’t you see what she is?
She’s the <i>Douro</i>!”</p>

<p>Harman’s hand flew up to shade his eyes. He stood
for twenty seconds, then he gave a whoop and made
as if to run to the sea edge, where the canoes were
preparing to put out.</p>

<p>Davis caught him by the arm and pulled him back.</p>

<p>“Who are you holdin’?” cried Harman. “Let
me get at the blighter! Leave me loose or I’ll give
you the bashin’ I have in me fist for him. Leave me
loose, you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Davis, undaunted and deaf to all protests, drove
him steadily back amongst the trees and then made
him sit down to hear reason.</p>

<p>“That chap would wipe the deck with you,” said
Davis. “There’s more ways of killing a dog than by
kicking him. What we’ve got to do is lay low and wait
our chance, get him ashore off his ship, and leave the
rest to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I can get my fists on him, that’s all <i>I</i>
want,” said Harman. “I don’t want more than that.”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied the other. “I want those pearls.
Now skip down to the house and fetch up all the grub
you can find. We’ve got to keep hid till things develop.
That’s our strong point: him not knowing we’re here.”</p>

<p>“And do you mean to say the Kanakas won’t tell
him?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose they do, suppose they say there
are two white men on the island, how’s he to know it’s
us? The Kanakas don’t know our names or where
we’ve come from. Now, skip!”</p>

<p>Harman went off, and returned laden. They made
their camp under a tree by a spring, covering the food
over with bread-fruit leaves to keep the robber crabs
from getting at it, then they settled themselves down
to watch and listen.</p>

<p>They heard the anchor go down, and Harman, who
climbed the tree to a point where a view of the harbour
could be glimpsed between the leaves, reported that
the <i>Douro</i> was at anchor two cable-lengths from the
shore and swinging to the tide, that the canoes were
all round her, and that a chap in white was leaning
over her rail.</p>

<p>“Looks like Clayton,” said he. “Now he’s left
the rail, and they’re swinging out a boat. He’s comin’
ashore. Now he’s in the boat. Yes, that’s him sure
enough; know him anywhere by the way he carries
himself, crawled over into the boat like a cat, he did.
Yes, it’s him; I can see his face now, all but his
b’iled gooseberry eyes. Comin’ ashore, are you?
Well, I’ll be there to meet you.”</p>

<p>He came swarming down only to be received into
the arms of Davis, that is to say, Reason.</p>

<p>“Coming on for night I don’t say no,” said Davis;
“we may be able to take the ship and get out with her,
but there’s no use in a free fight on the beach in the
broad light of day with all his boat crew to back
him. I’ve got an idea&mdash;it’s coming into my head bit
by bit&mdash;and it’s this, the crew know us.”</p>

<p>“Well, they ought to, since we captained them once,”
said Harman. “But what about it?”</p>

<p>“Just this, you know what Kanakas are. If we
can knock Clayton on the head sudden to-night and
get off without too much fuss, we’ve only got to step
on board and drop the anchor-chain and put out.
The Kanakas won’t object. Seeing us come on board
again, and taking over the ship, they’ll think it’s
all in the day’s work and done by arrangement with
Clayton.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t a bad idea if we can do it,” said Harman;
“we’ll have to scrag him so that he don’t squeal, and
do it without fittin’ him out for a mortuary. I ain’t
a particular man, but I’ve an objection to corpses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!” said Davis. “You’ve got to stow
that bilge if you want to make out in this business.
You’ll be going about next with flowers in your hair
like those Kanaka girls. I ain’t going to hit to kill.
If I get the chance of hitting at all. I’m going to put
him to sleep, that’s all; if he never wakes up the
world will be none the wiser nor the worse. Hullo!
What’s that?”</p>

<p>It was Kinie, her face showed peeping at them
through the branches which her little brown hands
were holding back.</p>

<p>“Scat!” cried Harman, shaken out of all other
considerations but the thought that she had discovered
their whereabouts and might give them away.
“Off with you, and back to the village&mdash;and if you
let a word out of you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Before he could finish the branches swayed, and
Kinie was gone.</p>

<p>“After her!” cried Davis. “Get hold of her and
tell her to spy on the chap, and give us news of what’s
going on. Hump yourself!”</p>

<p>Harman, getting on his feet, started off in pursuit,
and Davis found himself alone. He could hear the
wash of the beach and the far-off voices of the village,
and as he sat, putting things together in his mind,
the main question that kept recurring was whether
Clayton would put out after taking on fruit and water,
or whether he would stay.</p>

<p>After that came the question of the pearls. It
was six months now since the day he sailed from the
atoll, and he was still tinkering about amongst the
lesser islands; what had he done with the pearls?
He had evidently been to no port of importance
where he might have sold them, and if there was reason
in anything, there was reason in the supposition that
they were on board the <i>Douro</i>.</p>

<p>Davis chuckled to himself at the thought. The
thing was so simple. Once Clayton was put out of
count nothing could be easier than to row off, seize
the ketch and put out with her&mdash;the Kanaka crew
knew both him and his companion. Davis chuckled
at the thought that these same Kanakas had been
through the same process before when he and Harman
had “nicked” the <i>Araya</i>.</p>

<p>“And I bet you,” he said to himself as he lay listening
to the sounds of the beach and village, “I bet
you they don’t know they’ve been as good as stolen
twice, or that me and Billy aren’t part owners in the
show, turning up now and then to take command,
and give the other chaps a rest.” He chuckled at the
thought, and then Harman came back through the
trees, having interviewed Kinie.</p>

<p>The wayward one had shown surprising grip of
the situation and readiness to assist. Yes, she would
watch the white man with the red face, and find out
whether he was taking water on board that day, and
if not how long he was likely to stay; promising this
she had run off.</p>

<p>“And she’ll do it,” said Harman.</p>

<p>They had some food and smoked and drowsed
in the warm, dark hot-house atmosphere of the woods,
now silent as death with noon.</p>

<p>Then somewhere about two o’clock the branches
parted and the charming, sprite-like face of the girl
looked in upon their slumbers.</p>

<p>She had brought news. The big canoe was not
taking water that day nor fruit. It might stay many
days, also the big man had been bidden to a banquet
by the village, and the feast was to take place on the
edge of dark. They were preparing the palm toddy
now and killing chickens and two pigs. Listen!
She held up a finger and they could hear the far-off
clucking of chickens being chased only to be
choked. The pigs, clubbed senseless, had uttered no
complaint.</p>

<p>Then the branches swayed, and she was gone.</p>

<p>“This is good,” said Davis. “That chap is sure
to get drunk on the palm toddy, and so we’ll be saved
the bother of knocking him out.”</p>

<p>“Seems like Providence, don’t it?” said Mr.
Harman. “If you tell me there ain’t such a thing,
I tell you that there is&mdash;flat. Look at us, brought
here and landed as careful as baskets of eggs, and look
at Clayton sent after us to be skinned, ain’t that
Providence?”</p>

<p>“Oh, close up!” said Davis. “You get arguing
when a chap ought to be thinking. Wait till he is
skinned before you talk of Providence. We haven’t
got the hide yet.”</p>

<p>“No, but we will,” replied the other, settling
himself for a snooze.</p>

<p>Towards dark, awakened by Davis, he went off
through the trees to prospect.</p>

<p>Then blackness came as if turned on with a switch,
blackness that gradually died to starlight as the
eyes grew accustomed to the change. Starlight that
filled the woods with the eeriest forms made of foliage
and shadow, while here and there stars and constellations
hung themselves amidst the branches&mdash;the Cross
in a tamarisk tree and Canopus on the top bough of a
screw pine.</p>

<p>To Davis, watching and meditating, suddenly
appeared Harman, breathless.</p>

<p>“We’re dished,” cried the latter, “dished lovely!
The <i>Douro</i> crowd are ashore down to the ship’s cat,
and they’re all stuffin’ themselves and fillin’ up with
the drink.”</p>

<p>Davis whistled.</p>

<p>“Haven’t they left an anchor watch on her?”</p>

<p>“Devil a one!” said Harman. “She’s watching
herself. Well, what do you say to that?”</p>

<p>Davis said nothing for a moment.</p>

<p>It was impossible to take the ketch away without
the crew. Of course, he and Harman could have
taken her out, but he knew better than ever to dream
of facing the Pacific in a vessel of that tonnage with
only another pair of hands to help him. He had been
through the experience years ago; he knew what it
was for two men to take on a ten-men’s job. No, the
canoe was better than that, infinitely.</p>

<p>“Billy,” said he suddenly, “buck up! We aren’t
done. Can’t you see, the chap is so certain sure there’s
no one here to harm or meddle with him, he’s let all
his crew come ashore? Well, as sure as he’s done
that, he’s left the pearls on board.”</p>

<p>Harman fell to the idea at once.</p>

<p>“You mean us to skip in the canoe with them?”</p>

<p>“Yep,” said the other.</p>

<p>Harman considered for a bit in silence, while the
sounds of the festival on the beach came on the new-risen
wind from the sea.</p>

<p>He had sworn never to enter a canoe again, the
prospect was hateful; yet there was one bright spot
in it, a spot as big as a sun&mdash;Clayton’s face on waking
next morning to find the pearls gone!</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Kim on,” said he, “we’ve gotta get water, grub,
and nuts aboard her. The breaker’s lying back of the
house. I’ll attend to the water; you can bring this
stuff down and c’llect all you can from the houses&mdash;b’nanas
and such-like. Hump yourself!”</p>

<p>Their canoe lay on the beach to the right of the
village; it was fit and seaworthy for the very good
reason that the native boys had been using it for
sailing and fishing, and when Davis came on to the
beach he found Harman stowing the water-breaker, the
only figure visible, for the whole village was congregated
where the great feast was going on in the break
amidst the trees.</p>

<p>They were running no risks. They wanted food
for a fortnight, and they took it&mdash;took it from the
deserted houses and from the trees where the pandanus
drupes hung in the starlight and the great
banana clusters stood like golden candelabra waiting
to be lit.</p>

<p>Then they pushed off, and the harbour took them
and the night, against which stood the <i>Douro</i>, swinging
to the outgoing tide on a taut anchor-chain.</p>

<p>The ladder was down, and as they came alongside,
Harman, who was to commit the burglary, clutched
it, sprang on deck, and lowering the anchor-light
vanished with it down the cabin companion-way.</p>

<p>Davis, with his hand on the ladder and rocked by
the almost imperceptible swell, contemplated the
night and the far beach. He could see the glow of the
fire amidst the trees, and now, just as the moon rose
above the sea-line, sending its silver across the harbour,
his keen eye caught a form moving amongst the
beached canoes.</p>

<p>A moment later something ruffled the water. A
canoe had put off. He saw the flash of a paddle, and
for a second the idea that Clayton had sensed danger
and was on the pounce crossed his mind, only to be
instantly dismissed. It was Kinie. He knew it
instinctively and at once. Kinie, who never drank
palm toddy and who looked as though her food were
mushrooms and moonbeams, had discovered their
canoe gone. Very likely had been watching them
getting it away and was coming out to prospect.</p>

<p>At that moment the light reappeared on deck,
and Harman at the rail.</p>

<p>“Bud,” cried Harman, “she’s bustin’ with trade,
cabin full, and I’ll bet the hold’s full to the hatches!
That blighter must have been peddlin’ his pearls for
trade goods, but I’ve got the balance, a dozen big ’uns.
I broke his locker open and there they were. Got ’em
in me pocket. Steady the blistered canoe whiles I
get in.”</p>

<p>He dropped into the canoe, and they pushed off.
Then he sighted Kinie, who was coming up fast, so
close now that the water drops showed flashing from
her paddle.</p>

<p>“It’s that girl,” said Davis, “confound her! We
only wanted this to kibosh us. I swear by the big
horn spoon I’ll flatten her out with a paddle if she
squeals or gives the show away! I will, b’ gosh!”</p>

<p>But Kinie showed no signs of any desire to give
the show away. She manœuvred her canoe so that
it came gently beside theirs, stem towards stern,
so that her outrigger did not prevent her from clasping
their gunnel. Kinie had come to say good-bye.
She had watched them provisioning without knowing
exactly why they were doing so, then they had put off,
and she had recognized that they were leaving for good.</p>

<p>Seeing them hanging on to the ship, she had taken
heart and put off herself, and now, patting Harman
on the shoulder with her little hand, she was looking
at him with the eyes of a dog, while he, slipping one
huge arm round her, was patting her back and telling
her to be a good girl and to get back to the shore
quick.</p>

<p>“<i>Aroya manu</i>, Kinie. We’re off&mdash;we’re goin’ away.
See you again maybe, soon. There, don’t be holdin’
me. Well, you’re askin’ for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, close up or you’ll be capsizing the canoe,”
cried Davis. “Shove her off&mdash;Now paddle for all
you’re worth. Mind! the outrigger is lifting.”</p>

<p>The canoes parted and the moonlit waving water
came between them like a river, then, driven by tide
and paddle, they passed the shadows of the cliffs at
the harbour mouth, and Harman, looking back, saw the
glow of the festival fire like a topaz beyond the silver-satin
of the harbour water, and against the glow the
canoe of Kinie making for the shore.</p>

<p>Outside they ran up the sail while astern Motul,
with its hills and dark forests, lay like a cloud on the
water, visible all night, dwindling to a speck in the
dawn, destroyed utterly by the sun as he rose beyond it,
flooding the sea with fire.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s another blessed day,” said Harman,
as he took his trick with the steering paddle, “and
that chap will be wakin’ just now with a palm-toddy
head on him to find we’ve done him, but he won’t never
know it’s us, worse luck. Anyhow, he’ll have his
headache. There ain’t nothin’ to beat a palm-toddy
head unless maybe samshu, but, samshu or palm toddy,
drink don’t pay, nor Bourbon, nor Champagne&mdash;it
don’t pay. I’m not sayin’ if a chap could get drunk
and stay drunk I wouldn’t be the first to jine in, but
it’s the wakin’ up&mdash;&mdash;Oh, <i>d&mdash;&mdash;n</i> petticuts!”</p>

<p>He had put his hand in his pocket for the
handkerchief, at that moment flaunting itself on Motul
beach around the brows of its proud possessor.</p>

<p>“Mind your steering!” cried Davis. “What ails
you? Mind your paddle or we’ll be over.”</p>

<p>“Me handkerchief’s gone,” cried the distracted
Harman. “She’s took it. Twice she nicked it from
me before, and I ought to ha’ known&mdash;she’ll have
flung them away, for it’s only the rag she wanted&mdash;buzzed
them into the harbour most like. They were
tied in the corner of it and she’d ha’ thought them
stones&mdash;ten thousand dollars’ worth of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pearls!” cried Davis, “you aren’t talking of the
pearls!”</p>

<p>Towards sunset, steering into the golden remote
and unknown west, the dejected Harman, breaking an
all-day silence, perked up a bit and became almost
cheerfully philosophic.</p>

<p>“The only good p’int about all this business,”
said he, “the one bright p’int&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Davis, “you and your p’ints.”</p>

<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>The mat sail flapped against the mast and then
hung loose while the chuckle of bow and
outrigger died away. Harman, turning his face
to the east, all gone watery with the dawn, leant
forward and gave his sleeping companion a prod
with the steering paddle.</p>

<p>Cruising in a South Sea island canoe tries the temper
as well as the judgment, and two days of this business
had considerably shortened the temper of Billy
Harman.</p>

<p>For two days and two nights, fed on bananas and
island truck, and led by the pointing of an indifferent
compass, they had pursued the west, chased by the
light of gorgeous dawns, broiled by midday suns,
raising nothing but endless horizons and consuming
sunsets.</p>

<p>“Wind’s gone!” cried Harman. “Flat calm and
looks like stayin’ put.”</p>

<p>Davis roused, supported himself with a hand on
the outrigger gratings, and blinked at the dawn;
then he yawned, then he began to get command of
speech.</p>

<p>“Whach you want digging me in the ribs like that
for?” said Davis. “You and your flat calms!
Where’s the hurry? Are you afraid it’ll run away?
Blest if you aren’t the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No use quarrellin’,” cut in the other; “fightin’s
a mug’s game, and words won’t bring no wind. Pass
us a drinkin’ nut.”</p>

<p>Davis passed the nut, and then, while the other
refreshed himself, leant with his elbow on the grating
and his eyes fixed lazily on the east.</p>

<p>Morning bank there was none, nor colour, nothing
but a great crystal window showing infinite distance
and taking suddenly a reflection of fire and a sill of
gold: gold that moved and ran north and south
and then leapt boiling across the swell as the sun
burst up, hitting Harman in the back and Davis in
the face and turning the lingering moon to a grey
cinder above the azure of the west and the morning
sea.</p>

<p>Away to the south, across the sunlit swell, a ship
showed becalmed and painting the water with the
reflection of her canvas, and, wonder of wonders, a
mile from her and more to the north stood another
ship, also held in the grip of the calm, and seeming
the duplicate of the first in rig, tonnage, and
design.</p>

<p>They were whalers, two of the last of the old
whaling fleet, cruising maybe in company or brought
together by chance.</p>

<p>Harman was the first to sight them; then Davis
turned, and, leaning comfortably on the outrigger
gratings, looked.</p>

<p>“Whalemen,” said Harman. “Look at ’em, stump
topmasts, tryin’-out works and all! Look at ’em&mdash;damned
pair of slush tubs!”</p>

<p>Davis said nothing; he spat into the water and
continued to look while Harman went on.</p>

<p>“There you are, grumblin’ last night there were
no ships about, and them things only waitin’ to show
themselves, castin’ the canoe in the teeth o’ Providence,
sayin’ you wanted planks under your feet to walk
on. Planks, b’gosh! If one of them sight us we’ll
be planked! I’ve been there and I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they won’t bother about us,” said Davis.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t they?” said Harman. “Shows what
you know of whalemen. If them chaps sighted the
twelve ’postles driftin’ in a canoe, let alone us, they’d
yank ’em on board and set ’em to work. Hands is
what they’re always cravin’ for, and our only chance
is they’ll take us for Kanakas, goin’ by the cut of
the canoe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they won’t bother about us,” said Davis;
“and if they do, you ain’t a bad imitation of a Kanaka;
but it’s cursed luck all the same. Planks, yes, I want
the feel of a plank under my foot, and the feel that
there isn’t only ten days’ grub and water between
us and perdition&mdash;curse them!”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it!” cried Harman. “Look!
They’re comin’!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, as though the last words of Davis
had struck life into the far-off vessels, the decks of
both ships suddenly boiled with ant-like figures,
boats were dropped, and in a flash were making across
the sea, two fleets of four boats each, and rowing as
if in a race.</p>

<p>But they were not making for the canoe. Due
north they headed over the glassy swell, while Davis,
standing erect and holding on to the mast, watched
with shaded eyes.</p>

<p>“Whales,” said he. “Whales they’re after, not
us. Look at them!”</p>

<p>“I can’t see no whales,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“No, but they can,” said Davis. “Look! They’re
heading west now, they’re on to them.”</p>

<p>A clap of thunder came over the sea and foam
spurted amidst the distant boats. Then two of the
boats detached themselves from the rest, skimming
through the water without sail or oar, the flash of
the foam at their bows clear to be seen.</p>

<p>“They’ve got their fish,” cried Harman. “Look,
he’s going round to the north’ard, and here’s the
breeze!”</p>

<p>Up from the south-east it was coming, spreading
in great waves like fields of barley. The whale-ships
had caught it and were trimming their yards in pursuit
of the boats, and now, the mat sail of the canoe
filling out and cracking against the mast, Harman
seized the steering paddle and headed her due north.</p>

<p>“Where are you steering for?” shouted Davis.</p>

<p>“North,” replied the other. “You don’t want to
be runnin’ into them ships, do you?”</p>

<p>Davis crawled aft, seized the paddle, and pushed
the other forward.</p>

<p>“Cuss the ships!” said he. “They’ve got their
own business to attend to, and I’m not going to put
her off her course, not for Jim Satan! You don’t
mind the ships&mdash;they’re busy.”</p>

<p>He was right.</p>

<p>A Swenfoyn gun had put a speedy end to the whale,
and as the canoe drew along not half a mile away
from the nearest ship it was being hauled alongside
her and the tackles were out. But the remainder
of the fleet of boats not busy in this work seemed
engaged in some affair of their own which was
not whale fishing; they were all surging together,
oars were being tossed in the air and the far-away
sound of shouting came across the water.</p>

<p>“Fightin’!” said Harman, “that’s what they’re
at. They’re both claimin’ the fish. I know their
monkey tricks. Look at them!”</p>

<p>But Davis was not listening to him, his quick eye
had caught something floating ahead; altering the
course a point he called to Harman to let go the sheet,
then, leaning over, he grabbed the floating mass in
both hands, yelling to the other to balance the canoe.</p>

<p>“Get out on the gratings and hold her down,” cried
Davis, “our fortune’s made. Fish! No, you fool,
it’s ambergris, what comes from whales’ innards,
and is worth hundreds of pounds. Lord send they
don’t see us!”</p>

<p>“Mind!” yelled Harman.</p>

<p>The gunnel lipped the water despite his weight
and the outrigger rose a foot as Davis strove, then
with a mighty effort he brought it tumbling on board,
the water pouring off it, and there it lay between his
feet a huge, knobby, putty-coloured mass, with
octopus sucker-prongs sticking in it like tiger claws,
and a two-fathom strip of pale green seaweed twined
about it as if for ornament. Harman, without a word,
crawled back across the outrigger grating and trimmed
the sail while Davis, without a word, resumed the
steering paddle.</p>

<p>He did not mind about altering his course now;
he put her dead before the wind while Harman, half
kneeling on the stub of the forward outrigger pole,
and with his hand on a stay, reported progress.</p>

<p>“No, they ain’t seen us,” said Harman; “they’re
all crowdin’ back on the ships and the fightin’s over.
There’s never no good in fightin’, as I said to you
this mornin’&mdash;not unless you get the other chap’s
back to you and belt him on the head sudden. Now
if those ballyhoos had quit arguin’ who’d harpooned
first and kept their eyes skinned they’d a’ got ambergris
instead of sore heads. How much ’s that stuff
worth, do you reckon, Bud?”</p>

<p>“Mean to say you don’t know and you been on
a whale-ship?”</p>

<p>“Never heard tell of the stuff before nor sighted
it,” replied the other. “Whalemen don’t take
stock of nothing but blubber&mdash;where does it come
from, d’ye think?”</p>

<p>“Out of the whale,” said Davis, “and it’s worth
twenty dollars an ounce.”</p>

<p>Harman laughed. When Bud had worked upon
him sufficiently to make him see the truth he first
took a look to make sure the whale-ships were showing
only their topsails above the horizon, then he
sat down to calculate the amount of their fortune.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>Ambergris, though used in the production of scent,
has no smell or only the faintest trace of odour when
warmed; it is the ugliest stuff in the world, and as
valuable as gold. Harman’s bother was that he did
not know the weight of the lump. He reckoned,
going by comparison with pigs of small ballast, that
it might be half a hundred-weight, but the table of
weights and measures barred him. He could not
tell the number of ounces in a half hundred-weight.</p>

<p>“Well, it don’t much matter,” said he at last.
“If you’re not lyin’ and it’s worth twenty dollars
an ounce, then it’s worth twenty times its weight
in dollars, and that’s good enough for us. Twenty
bags of dollars as heavy as that lump of muck is
good enough for Billy Harman. Say, it beats Jonah,
don’t it? when you look at that stuff, which isn’t
more nor less than good dinners by the hundred
and bottles of fizz and girls by the raft-load. And
to think of an old whale coughin’ it up; makes a
chap b’lieve in the Scriptures, don’t it, seein’ what
it is and seein’ where it come from, and seein’ how
Providence shoved it right into our hands.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t cashed it yet,” said Davis.</p>

<p>“No, but we will,” replied the other. “I feel it
in my bones. I’ve got a hunch the luck ain’t runnin’
streaky this time. Somethin’ else is comin’ along;
you wait and see.”</p>

<p>He was right. Next morning, an hour after sunrise,
a stain of smoke showed on the south-eastern
horizon.</p>

<p>Steamers in those days were fewer in the Pacific
even than now, but this was a steamer right enough.</p>

<p>“She’s coming dead for us,” said Davis, as the
hull showed clear now of smoke. “Brail up the sail
and stand by to signal her&mdash;what you make her out
to be?”</p>

<p>“Mail boat,” said Harman. “Sydney-bound, I’ll
bet a dollar. You’ll be hearin’ the passengers linin’
up and cheerin’ when we’re took aboard, and then
it’ll be drinks and cigars and the best of good livin’
till we touch Circular Wharf. But I ain’t goin’ in
for hard drinks, not till we cash in this ambergris,
and not then, only may be a bottle of fizz to wet the
luck. No, sir, seein’ Providence has dealt with us
handsome, Billy’s goin’ to do likewise with her.
Providence don’t hold with the jag, which ain’t
more nor less than buyin’ headaches, and di’mond
studs for bar tenders and sich. Providence is dead
against the drink, and don’t you forget that.”</p>

<p>“Why, you were talking only last night of buying
a saloon in ’Frisco,” said Davis.</p>

<p>“That ain’t buyin’ drink,” countered Mr. Harman.
“Nor swallerin’ it, which is what I’m arguin’
against&mdash;&mdash;Look at her how she’s liftin’.”</p>

<p>They said no more, watching the oncoming boat,
now showing her bridge canvas distinct from her
hull. Then suddenly Davis spoke.</p>

<p>“That’s no mail boat,” said Davis, “not big enough,
stove-pipe funnel, and look at that canvas. She’s
not even a B.P. boat&mdash;some old tub carrying copra
or trade.”</p>

<p>“Not she,” said Harman. “Steam don’t pay in
the copra business, bunkers have to be too big, seein’
there’s no coalin’ stations much in the islands.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” said Davis, and they did.</p>

<p>The stranger came shearing along, showing up now
as a five or six hundred ton squat cargo boat, riding
high and evidently in ballast, with a rust-red stove-pipe
funnel and a general air of neglect that shouted
across the sea.</p>

<p>Then the thud of the engines ceased, a yoop of her
siren cut the air like a whiplash, and a string of
bunting blew out.</p>

<p>Harman waved his shirt, and as the stranger came
gliding on to them he got ready to catch the rope
that a fellow was preparing to cast from the bow.</p>

<p>As they came alongside, lifting and falling with
the swell, a big red-faced man, leaning over the bridge
rail, began shouting directions, whilst Davis, seizing
the ladder which had been dropped, climbed on deck,
leaving Harman to manage the canoe.</p>

<p>The <i>Oskosh</i> was the name of the hooker, and Billy
Schumways was the name of her master and owner.
He was the big man on the bridge; seven days out
from Arafata Lagoon with a crew of Chinks and a
Savage Island bo’sun, makin’ down for Fuanatafi in
a hurry. All of which he roared at Davis from the
bridge and at Harman from over the bridge side.</p>

<p>“Claw on and kim up,” cried Captain Schumways
to the hesitating Harman. “Cut that canoe adrift
and come on deck, and don’t be wastin’ my time, or
I’ll ring the injins on. What’s that you’re sayin’?
Ambergris, what’s ambergris? Ain’t got no time to
be muckin’ about&mdash;there, bring it if you want to.”
He paused whilst Harman, having fastened a rope
flung by Davis round the precious ambergris, came
on deck guiding it up. Then, when they were both
over the rail, Schumways, ringing the engines full
speed ahead, came down from the bridge.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get that muck?” asked Captain
Schumways, after they’d given their names and a
yarn about having been drifted off an island when
fishing. “Picked it up, did you? Well, you can
shove it in the scupper if you’re set on keepin’ it,
and now follow me down and I’ll show you your
quarters. I’m sufferin’ for extra help in the engine-room
and I reckon you’ve got to work your passage.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the saloon hatch and down to the
saloon.</p>

<p>The <i>Oskosh</i> had been a Farsite Enfield boat running
from ’Frisco to Seattle. Cargo, Klondyke diggers
and, lastly, contraband had reduced her from respectability
and cleanliness to her present state. The
saloon was a wreck and ruin, the panelling split, the
fittings gone, bunks filled with raffle and oddments,
the table covered with old oil-cloth showing the
marks of coffee cups, and over all a dank throat-catching
atmosphere of decay, cockroaches and dirty
bunk bedding.</p>

<p>Schumways inhabited the cabin aft. He pointed
out two bunks to port and starboard.</p>

<p>“Them’s yours,” said he, “and there’s beddin’
and to spare. You’ll mess here, bein’ whites, and
you’ll take your orders from me and Sellers; when
you’ve cleared out them bunks and got your beddin’
in come along up and I’ll show you your job.”</p>

<p>He left them and went on deck, and Bud Davis
sat down on the edge of a bunk.</p>

<p>“Say, Billy,” said Bud, “how about those passengers
lining up and cheering? How about those
soft drinks you were talking of?&mdash;or would you sooner
have a highball?&mdash;and we’re to take our orders from
him and Sellers. What I’m proposing to do is go up
right now, catch him by the hoofs, and dump him
over side, scrag Sellers, whoever he is, and take the
ship. That’s how I’m feeling.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use,” said Harman. “Fightin’s a mug’s
game. That chap’s a sure enough tough and we
haven’t no guns. Lay low is the word, more especial
as this packet is contraband and we’ve only to wait
to get ’em by the short hairs. Contraband&mdash;look
at her, guns or opium, with blackbirdin’ maybe
thrown in, that’s all there is to her.”</p>

<p>Davis assented. These two old Pacific hands had
an eye from which no ship could hide her character
for sea-unworthiness or disrespectability; Schumways
matched his ship, and Sellers, when he turned
up, would be sure to match Schumways; the crew
were Chinks, and the case was plain. Not that it
bothered Bud or Billy; their one thought as they
worked clearing the bunks and settling the bedding
was the ambergris.</p>

<p>Schumways knew nothing of ambergris or its value&mdash;that
fact was quite plain&mdash;but it would never do to
leave it lying in the scupper, and Harman having
poked his head up through the hatch and found a
clear deck, they got it down, stowed it in a spare
bunk occupied by a filthy rug, a suit of oilskins and a
paraffin tin, covering it with the rug.</p>

<p>Then they came on deck, and the captain of the
<i>Oskosh</i>, coming down from the bridge, introduced
them to the engine-room and Sellers, a wire-drawn
Yankee, six feet two, who introduced them to the
engines and the stokehold.</p>

<p>“Chinks are firin’ her now,” said Sellers, “but
you’ll hold yourself ready to take a hand at the
shovellin’ if wanted. I’ll larn you how to shoot the
stuff; that’s a pressure gauge&mdash;you’ll get to know it
before you’ve done&mdash;and that’s an ile can&mdash;you’ll
get to know her too.” He led the way down a passage
four foot broad to a transverse passage eight foot
broad, where, under a swinging oil lamp, Chinks,
naked to the waist, were firing up. He opened the
door of a long blazing tunnel and seized a shovel,
the coal came down a chute right on to the floor, and
taking a shovelful he demonstrated.</p>

<p>“Stokin’s not shootin’ coal into a fu’nace, it’s
knowin’ where to shoot it. Every fu’nace has hungry
places: there’s one, that dull patch up there, and
there’s the food for it.” A shovelful of coal went
flying into the gehenna right on to the dull patch, and,
dropping the shovel, he seized an eight-foot bar of
steel. “M’r’over, it’s not all shovellin’, it’s rakin’.
Here’s your rake and how to use it. Then you’ve got
to tend the ashlift, and when you’ve larnt not to stick
your head in the fire when she’s pitchin’ hard you’ll
be a stoker; ain’t nothin’ to it but the work an’ the
will.”</p>

<p>“But see here, cully,” said Mr. Harman. “We
ain’t signed on for stokin’ in this packet; engine-room
fiddlin’ is stretchin’ a point with A.B.’s, but stokin’s
outside the regulations. Clear, and by Board o’ Trade
rules&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s them on board the <i>Oskosh</i>,” said Sellers,
producing a revolver, which he exhibited lying flat
in the palm of his huge hand as though he were showing
a curiosity. “Six rules an’ regulations, soft-nosed&mdash;and
don’t you forget it, son!”</p>

<p>Through days of blazing azure and nights of phosphorescent
seas the <i>Oskosh</i> plugged steadily along on
her course. She was square-rigged on the foremast,
and used sail-power to assist the engines when the wind
held, and always and ever, despite her dirt, her disorder,
and the general slovenliness of her handling,
she kept a bright eye out for strangers. When Schumways
was not on the bridge using the binoculars,
they were in the hands of the Savage Island bo’sun&mdash;a
fact noted by Billy and Bud when those unfortunates
had time to note anything in the midst of their
multitudinous occupations.</p>

<p>They were not always put to stoking in this horrible
ship, where things went anyhow and work was doubled
for want of method. They would be oiling in the
engine-room under command of Sellers when, maybe,
the voice of Schumways would come ordering “them
roustabouts” up to handle the sails: sail-handling,
greasing, emptying slush tubs, helping in engine-room
repairs, “lendin’ a hand in the stoke’old”&mdash;it was a
mixed meal of work that did not please the appetites
of Billy or Bud. Yet they had to swallow it. Kicking
was no use. Harman tried it, and was kicked by Sellers,
and took the injury and insult without retaliating.
Fighting was a mug’s game, but deep in his soul Billy
Harman formulated an oath of revenge, swearing that
somehow, somewhere, and somewhen he would be
even with the <i>Oskoshites</i> to the ultimate limit of
their back teeth and the last short hairs of their
persons.</p>

<p>He communicated this darkly to his fellow-sufferer,
who laughed.</p>

<p>They were seated at breakfast feasting on the
leavings of Schumways and Sellers and Davis told him
to close up.</p>

<p>“You give me the mullygrubs with your talk,”
said Davis. “Whenever you open your fool-mouth
something happens wrong way about. This was a
passenger packet, wasn’t it, and we were to sit in the
saloon bein’ admired by the passengers, weren’t we?
And was it Fourth Street or Fifth Street you were goin’
to open that whisky joint? And fighting is a mug’s
game, according to you, whereas if we’d wiped the
engine-room floor with Sellers first day instead of
knuckling down to him we’d have stood on this ship
as men, instead of being a hog-driven pair of roustabouts
begging for scraps and emptying slush tubs.
Too late now; they’ve got the better of us and know
our make, which is putty, owing to you. Even with
them! Why, I’ll bet twenty dollars to a nickel if
you try any of your home-made tricks they’ll be
even with us. Talking is all you’re good for&mdash;fighting’s
a mug’s game!”</p>

<p>“So it is,” replied Mr. Harman. “Fool fightin’s
no use; hittin’ out and gettin’ belted’s one thing,
but stragety’s another, and that’s what I’m after,
and if I don’t get my knife in these chaps’ ribs behind
their backs and unknownst to them, you can take
me home and bury me&mdash;and it won’t be long either!”</p>

<p>He was right.</p>

<p>That very evening they lifted Fuanatafi, their
destination, a purple cloud in the sunset glow and a
cloud of ebony by night as they lay off and on, listening
to the far sound of the breakers till dawn revealed
the great island in all its splendour and isolation;
for Fuanatafi, like Nauru, has no harbour, just a
landing beach to westward where boats can put in,
razor-backed reefs keep ships a mile from the shore
and make the place pretty useless for trade.</p>

<p>As the light broke full on the island Billy Harman,
who had come on deck and was standing with Davis
by the lee rail, saw away to southward another island
with a peak-like summit, and to westward of that two
small islets circled with moving clouds&mdash;gulls.</p>

<p>“Why, Lord bless my soul,” said he, “I’ve been
here before, six years ago it was, and we took off a raft
of turtle-shell for six cases of gin. Christopher Island
was the other name they give it, and it’s head centre
for all sorts of black doin’s. That island to suthard is
Levisca, and it’s been blackbirded till there ain’t
scarcely no Kanakas left on it. Now, I wonder what
Schumways is landin’ here.”</p>

<p>As if in answer to his question two Chinks came
aft carrying a long deal box between them, which
they dumped close by the foremast.</p>

<p>The main hatch was open, and they could see more
boxes being brought up, six in all, and each one, as it
came on deck, was carried forward, the whole being
stacked in one pile and covered with a tarpaulin. The
engines ceased their dead-slow tramp: then came an
order from the bridge and the roar and rasp of the
anchor chain filled the morning air, echoing across
the water and lifting the reef gulls in clanging
spirals.</p>

<p>Schumways dropped down from the bridge and
Sellers rose from the engine-room, wiping his hands
with a piece of cotton waste; he had put on his coat
and wore an old panama on his head ready for shore.
Then at an order from Schumways the starboard
quarter-boat was lowered, Harman and Davis were
ordered into it, and the Captain of the <i>Oskosh</i> and his
engineer took their places in the stern sheets.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more lovely than the morning
light on the streets of blue water between the reefs
or the view of the great island washed by the calm,
ponded sea and waiting for the approaching boat,
loveliness that left no trace, however, on the minds
of Bud and Billy labouring at the oars, or of Schumways
and Sellers smoking in the stern.</p>

<p>As they ran the boat’s nose on to the beach, out
from the groves to right and left stepped a dozen
Kanakas armed with spears. Casting their spears on
the sand, they trod on them whilst Sellers and his
companion, walking up the beach with hands outstretched,
greeted the chief man, bright with palm oil,
absolutely naked, and adorned simply with half a
willow-pattern soup plate worn as a pendant.</p>

<p>The Kanakas and the two whites seemed old friends,
and the whole lot, after a moment’s chatter, disappeared
into the groves, leaving Bud and Billy on the beach
by the stranded boat.</p>

<p>“They’re off to the village,” said Harman.
“Wonder what they’re up to? Bargainin’ most like
over them guns.”</p>

<p>“What guns?” asked Davis.</p>

<p>“Them cases we left on deck, them’s guns, or my
name’s not Billy Harman. There’s six guns in each
of them cases, that’s thirty-six for the lot, and I
expect Schumways will be askin’ old Catch-em-alive-o
ten pound apiece for them in coin or shell&mdash;maybe in
bêche-de-mer, for that’s as good as bank notes. That’s
three hundred and sixty pounds and the durned things
didn’t cost him sixty. I’ll bet&mdash;&mdash;” He turned.
Someone came breaking through the trees; it was
Sellers.</p>

<p>“Hike off back to the ship and bring them cases,”
cried Sellers, “the ones we’ve left on deck. If you
can’t bring the whole six, bring four, and you can go
back for the other two. Now then, you lazy sweeps,
grease yourselves and get goin’.”</p>

<p>“Blast him!” said Davis as they pushed off across
the inner lagoon towards the reef break leading to the
outer reef channels sparkling blue in the sun.</p>

<p>“No use swearin’,” said Hannan, “it don’t cut
no ice&mdash;&mdash; Bud, I’ve got them.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Davis.</p>

<p>“Got ’em all in the fryin’ pan, b’gosh. It’s only
jumped into my head this minute. Told you I’d
get even with them at last, and now I’ve as good as
done it.”</p>

<p>“What’s your plan?” asked Bud.</p>

<p>“You never mind,” replied Billy, “you do as I’m
askin’ you and I’ll show you. Lay into your strokes
now, and that’s all you have to do at the present
minit.”</p>

<p>He seemed delighted with himself as he rowed,
chuckling and chortling as though he already had the
<i>Oskoshites</i> down and out. Bud, who knew Billy’s
mentality from long practice and use, was not so
elated. He knew that Harman, amongst his other
mental qualities, was likely to go blind of one eye
when seeing red or when ambition was at fever heat,
and Billy was undoubtedly seeing red. Full of the
thirst for revenge at having been made to work, at
having been kicked and spoken to with contumely,
he was fit for anything just now.</p>

<p>“What is it that’s in your mind, Billy?” asked the
other as they drew up to the <i>Oskosh</i>.</p>

<p>“You wait and see,” said Harman; “say nuthin’
and follow my lead prompt and we’ve got them on a
split stick.”</p>

<p>The Chinks stood by the ladder as Harman went
up it, leaving Davis to mind the boat; then on deck
he gave the Kanaka bo’sun his orders, and, while the
cases were being got into the boat, stepped below.</p>

<p>He came up in a few minutes and helped with the
last case, then, dropping into the boat beside Davis,
he pushed off and they began rowing towards the
shore.</p>

<p>“Go slow,” said Harman, “and don’t pull hard.
The breeze is backin’ into the north and I’ll have the
mast up in a minute, then we can run for Levisca.
We could row there quick enough, but it’s easier to
sail. After we’ve taken on grub and water there we
can push farther south.”</p>

<p>“What the blue blazes are you talking of?” said
Davis. “You mean running away in this boat?”</p>

<p>“Yep,” replied Harman.</p>

<p>“But, you fool, they’ll up steam and be after us
before we’ve got half-way there.”</p>

<p>“Not they,” replied the strategist, “you wait an’
see. You keep your eye on the old <i>Oskosh</i> and you’ll
see somethin’ funny in a minute.”</p>

<p>He ceased rowing, so did Davis, and the boat rocked
on the swell, then, as he got the mast stepped and the
sail shaken out, Davis, whose eyes were fixed on the
far-off ship, gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, she’s lying awfully low in the water.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harman quite simply. “I’ve opened
the sea-cocks.”</p>

<p>“You’ve <i>what</i>?” cried the other.</p>

<p>“Opened the sea-cocks when I went below. The
Chinks haven’t twigged yet that she’s sinkin’, she’s
goin’ peaceful as a dyin’ Christian. Look”&mdash;a
column of steam was rising from the funnel of the
sinking ship&mdash;“they’ve twigged it now, but they don’t
know what’s sinkin’ her, and if they did they haven’t
enough sense to know what to do. B’sides, it’s too
late. Look, they’re gettin’ out the boats; now help
me to dump these durned cases and bring the sheet aft.”</p>

<p>Davis did as he was told, then as the boat lay over,
making a long board for Levisca, he suddenly leant
forward towards Harman, his face injected with blood.</p>

<p>“You’ve done it, haven’t you?” shouted Davis.</p>

<p>“Yes, b’gosh I have,” said Harman complacently,
his eyes fixed on the <i>Oskosh</i> sinking by the head and
with her stem high in the air.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t tell me your plans, would you? So full
of hitting Schumways you had no thought of anything
else, weren’t you? Well, you sainted fool, what about
that ambergris?”</p>

<p>“What ambergris? Oh, Lord! the ambergris,”
said the wretched Harman, suddenly remembering.
“We’ve left it behind!”</p>

<p>“You’ve left it, you mean. What would it have
cost to have taken two Chinks down and fetched it up
and stowed it in the boat? Not a nickel&mdash;and it
was worth twenty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>Harman said nothing. The <i>Oskosh</i> was making
her last plunge and the over-loaded boats were making
for shore, then his face slowly brightened as the face
of Sellers and the face of Schumways rose before him&mdash;the
two men who had forcibly introduced him to work.
“It was worth it,” said he; “if it was five hundred
dollars an ounce, it was worth it.”</p>

<p>“What was worth it?” asked Davis.</p>

<p>“Losin’ that ambergris,” replied Mr. Harman.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER V.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A DEAL WITH “PLAIN SAILIN’ JIM”</span>
</h2>

<p class='ni'>He was the only blot on the scenery, also he was
fishing, fishing from a rock washed by water
forty feet deep in which the coloured bream passed
like jewels through a world of crystal.</p>

<p>Matadore Island clings to its old Spanish name,
though it is French, lying west of Vavitu in the great
French sea territory born of the League of Nations
that stretches now from the Marquesas to Rapa and
from Bellinghausen to Gambier.</p>

<p>It is a tiny island, too small for trade, horned
with dangerous reefs, but beautiful with the green
of Jack-fruit tree and coco palm, the blue of sea and
the white of foam and coral.</p>

<p>Gulls make their home on the reefs, laughing gulls
and cormorants and great predatory gulls, sailing
to seaward in the dawn and clanging home at night
after a sweep of hundreds of miles to where the
swimmer rocks show white manes, or the Skagways
their teeth. The gulls were jeering now as the fisherman
hauled in his line, coiled it on the coral and stood
up, shading his eyes.</p>

<p>Away over the sparkling blue to s’uth’ard stood
something that was either the fin of a sail-fish or the
sail of a boat, something sharp and triangular, clear
now to the sight and now half gone as the sea-dazzle
affected the eyes of the gazer.</p>

<p>He was a tall, thin man, bronzed to the colour
of a cobnut, tattooed on the left hand in such a way
that he seemed to wear a mitt, and his face as he
stood straining his eyes seaward was the face of Uncle
Sam, goatee beard and all.</p>

<p>As he watched, the jaws of this individual worked
slowly and methodically like the jaws of a cow chewing
the cud, then as the boat’s hull showed close in and
making for the clear passage through the reefs, he flung
up his arms, turned, and came scrambling down over
the coral to the salt white beach, towards which the
boat was coming now, the sail furled, and oars out and
straight for destruction on a rock in the fairway.
There were only two men in her.</p>

<p>“Sta’board your helm, you &mdash;&mdash; fools!” yelled
Uncle Sam. “Cayn’t you see the sunk reef before
your noses? <i>Sta</i>’board&mdash;that’s right.” Then a tone
lower: “B&mdash;&mdash;y tailors!”</p>

<p>He rushed out as the boat came barging on to the
beach and seized the starboard gunnel, whilst the
bow oar, tumbling over, seized the port, and the stern
oar, taking to the water, clapped on; then, having
dragged her nose well above tide-mark, they turned
one to another for speech.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been here three months and maybe
more,” said the tall man, as they sat on the coral by
the beach watching the boat and the strutting gulls
and half-a-dozen stray Kanakas who had come down
to take a peep at the strangers. “Wrecked?&mdash;nuthin’&mdash;did
a bunk from a hooker that shoved in
here for water an’ nuts, and here I’ve stuck, snug
as Moses in the bulrushes, nuthin’ to pay for board
an’ bunk, no use for a n’umbrella, place crawlin’ with
girls, and every pa’m tree a pub, if you know how
to make pa’m toddy&mdash;name’s Keller, and what might
your’n be?”</p>

<p>“Mine’s Harman,” said the bigger and broader of
the strangers, “and this is Bud Davis. Reckon
we’ve run more’n three hundred miles in that boat,
steerin’ by our noses and blind as ballyhoos&mdash;and as to
where we’ve come from&mdash;well, that’s a matter of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t askin’ no questions!” cut in the
tall man. “It’s nuthin’ to me if you stole your boat
or had her give you, or whether you come from Noumea
or the Noo Jerusalem. I’m ‘Plain Sailin’ Jim,’ I
am, straight with them that’s straight with me, hungerin’
for the sight of a white mug, and fed up with
chocolate biscuits. ‘Plain Sailin’ Jim,’ that’s me,
and smilin’ I am to welcome gentlemen like yourselves
to this virgin home of palm toddy and polygamy.”</p>

<p>“What sort of truck is that?” asked the ingenuous
Harman.</p>

<p>But Keller did not hear him, he had risen to chase
some Kanaka children away from the boat; then,
hitching up his trousers, he led the way through the
trees to the grass-thatched village where the little
houses stood bowered with yellow cassi and blue-blazing
convolvulus, and where at the door of the
biggest and newest house his chief wife sat preparing
kava in a bowl of stone.</p>

<p>They dined off baked pig, taro, palm salad, and palm
toddy in a twilight through which rays from the
thatch pierced like golden needles, and as they ate
they could see through the door space the village
with its tree-ferns and thatched houses, the children
playing in the sun, and the men lazing in the shade.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use for work and ain’t no use for fightin’,”
said Keller, referring to the men of the village.
“Chawin’ bananas and fishin’ is all they’re good for,
bone-lazy lot. I’ll larn them!”</p>

<p>Two or three of his wives served the dinner and
prepared the palm toddy; then, after the dishes had
been removed, Keller, the toddy mounting to his head,
beat another wife who had dared to poke a hole in
the wall to peep at the strangers, kicked a dog that
got in his way, raised Cain all down the street with a
four-foot length of bamboo, and fell like a log dead
asleep under the shade of a Jack-fruit tree.</p>

<p>“There ain’t no flies on old man Keller,” said Billy
Harman to Bud Davis, as they walked next morning
in the sun on the beach. “I tell you I like that
chap.”</p>

<p>“Meaning Keller?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Jumping Moses!&mdash;and what do you like about
him?” asked the astonished Davis.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harman, “takin’ him by and large,
he seems to me a trustable chap&mdash;goin’ by what he
says. It’s straight out and have done with it when
he’s talkin’, same as when he’s kickin’ a Kanaka. I
likes him because there ain’t nothin’ hidden about
him&mdash;look at all them wives of his and he ownin’ up
to them without a wink. ‘“Plain Sailin’ Jim,”
that’s my name,’ says he, ‘straight with them that’s
straight and crooked with them that’s crooked.’ You
heard him&mdash;and that’s his label or I’m a digger Injin.
No, there ain’t no flies on Keller.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard him,” said Davis, “and taking him
by and large I’d label him the king of the yeggmen,
hot from yeggtown. No, sir, you don’t take in Bud
Davis with artificial flies and that chap may ‘Plain
Sailin’ Jim’ himself to the last holoo of the last trumpet,
but he won’t put the hood on chaps that have eyes
in their heads, nor noses to sniff a rotten character.”</p>

<p>“There you go,” said Harman, “startin’ out after
your own ideas and chasin’ them till they look like
a man. Think bad of a chap and he’ll look bad&mdash;that’s
my motto, and I’m not goin’ to think bad of
Keller.”</p>

<p>But Davis had lost interest in Keller. Something
out at sea had caught his eye, and taking Harman
by the arm, he pointed over the dead calm water.</p>

<p>“Look there,” said he.</p>

<p>Harman, shading his eyes, looked in the direction
indicated.</p>

<p>“It ain’t the pa’m toddy, is it?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“No,” said the other, “it’s a craft of some sort or
another; what do you make of her?”</p>

<p>“Nuthin’, she ain’t nacheral&mdash;looks like a cross
between Noah’s ark an’ a floatin’ hayrick rigged with
a double set of masts and a&mdash;&mdash; Why, Lord bless
my soul if she ain’t a junk, a junk and a schooner lashed
together, that’s what she is, derelick and driftin’.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Davis, his mind jumping at once to
the truth. “Call Keller&mdash;run and roust him out.
Here he comes. Keller, hi, Keller! Ship drifting
out beyond the reefs. Look sharp!” He had no
need to give directions. Like a vulture scenting a
carcass, Keller came swooping, shaded his eyes and
stood.</p>

<p>“It’s a junk and schooner,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“<i>Bêche-de-mer</i> boat or opium smuggler,” said
Keller, “and they’re both abandoned and driftin’.
There’s pickin’s here, boys. After me!” He raced
down to the beach, followed by the others, to where
the boat was hauled up, they pushed her out and, Keller
steering, made through the fairway, past the submerged
rock towards the open sea.</p>

<p>Not a breath of wind stirred the swell to break
the shimmering reflections of the spars and sails of
the locked ships. Stem to stern they lay, the junk
spars locked in the rigging of the schooner, the two
great eyes painted on the Chinaman’s bows staring
straight at the oncoming boat. Round and about the
deserted ships fins moved and grey forms glided in the
green&mdash;sharks. On the smooth water, the letters
on the counter repainted the name of the schooner,
<i>Haliotis</i>.</p>

<p>Keller gave the order to lay in the oars, and they
came duddering along the schooner’s side, Harman
standing up. He seized one of the stanchions of the
rail and was about to hoist himself on deck when
Keller bade him stop.</p>

<p>“A minit,” said Keller, “who’s to tell it’s not a
trap. Claw on and listen.”</p>

<p>The cry of a far-off gull on the reefs came, and the
creak and grind of the ships’ sides as the swell lifted
them. No other sound but the occasional click of
the rudder chain as the rudder of the schooner shifted
with the heave and fall of the hull.</p>

<p>Then, sure of themselves, with the cry of predatory
animals, they tumbled on board, fastened up and
scattered, Bud and Billy over the decks of the schooner,
Keller, led by some vulturous instinct, on to the junk.</p>

<p>“Here’s a stiff,” shouted Harman as Davis followed
him forward towards a bundle lying by the galley.
“Lord, <i>ain’t</i> he a stiff? Head split with a hatchet.
Here’s two more.” He pointed to a foot protruding
from the galley, where lay a Chink and a white man,
both very stiff indeed.</p>

<p>Then, turning and quite unconcerned, they came
racing aft and down through the companion-way to
the little cabin.</p>

<p>Here everything was quiet and trim; on the table
under the swinging lamp lay a soap dish and shaving
brush and razor. Someone had been shaving himself
before the little mirror on the after bulkhead when
whatever happened had begun to happen. In the
after cabin, presumably the captain’s, the bunk bedding
showed just as the sleeper had left it when he turned
out. Then they set to and rooted round, the instinct
for plunder so strong on them that they forgot Keller,
the stiffs, the tragedy and the very place where they
were.</p>

<p>They found a gold watch and chain which Harman
put in his pocket, and a gold ring and fountain pen
which Davis promptly annexed, they found the log,
which, being written in Spanish, was useless to them,
and the ship’s money, a big chamois leather chinking
bag of Australian sovereigns. This glorious find
recalled Keller.</p>

<p>“Bud,” said Billy, “this h’ain’t nothing to do with
<i>him</i>; hide them, swaller them; here, give me your
handkerchief and take half, tie them up tight so’s
they won’t chink. I’ll keep my lot in the bag. He
won’t guess nothin’, he’ll think the chows have cleared
the place&mdash;ain’t nothin’ more to take, is there? Then
come ’long and have a squint at the lazarette.”</p>

<p>The lazarette was full of food, all sorts of canned
things; then, hearing Keller’s voice above, up they
came demure as cats out of a dairy to find the long man
waving his arms like a windmill. His goatee beard
was sticking out like a brush and his eyes flaming.</p>

<p>“Dope!” cried Keller. “Boys, our fortunes is
made. Canton opium, blue label tins and worth two
thousand dollars if it’s worth a jitney. Kim along
down and howk them out.” He led the way on to the
junk’s deck and below to the awful interior smelling
of opium, joss sticks, stale fish and shark oil; there on
the floor in the dismal twilight lay the tins arranged
by Keller in a heap.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Keller, “the schooner either went
for the chows or the chows for the schooner. Maybe
they all killed each other, or maybe the chaps that
were left took fright seein’ a cruiser or fancyin’ one&mdash;reckon
that was the way, for there ain’t no boats left,
but the dinghy. Well, it’s all a durn sea mystery,
and I’ve seen queerer&mdash;but there’s the dope, come
along and hoist it.”</p>

<p>They brought the tins up and over to the schooner’s
deck, got a tarpaulin and tied them up in it, and
then, and not till then, took stock of their position.
The drift of the current had left the island a good way
to the south, but there it lay green, lovely and inviting,
the glassy swell pearling round the coral.</p>

<p>Keller, turning from the opium tins to this picture,
gazed for a moment, his jaws working in contemplation.
Then he turned to the others.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Keller, “it’s either go back or stick.
I’m for sticking, if there’s water and grub enough
on board. You see, if we take this dope back ashore,
we won’t never be able to realise on it; any ship takin’
us off will say, ‘What’s in that bundle?’ and there
won’t be no use sayin’ it’s bibles. Whereas if we can
make a port in this hooker we can claim salvage, and
leavin’ that alone we can ten to one get rid of the
dope.”</p>

<p>“There’s grub enough,” said Davis, “to judge by
the lazarette, and there’s pretty sure to be enough
water&mdash;two minutes will tell, but first, let’s get those
stiffs overboard. No use putting sinkers to them, the
sharks will finish them before they’ve sunk a fathom.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the decision was come to and
the boat got on board.</p>

<p>They had found water and food enough for months,
it only wanted a breeze to break the ships apart,
and Keller reckoned that the three of them would be
able to manage the schooner. Davis was a fair navigator,
the charts and compass had not been damaged
or removed, and with Matadore for a point of departure
they ought to be able to reach the Fijis. So it was
settled.</p>

<p>Harman, leaning on the rail when the decision was
come to, fancied that he could hear a whisper from
the beach of the far-away island, the whisper of the
swell breaking on the coral where the wives of Keller
were no doubt congregated, abandoned&mdash;chucked away
for the prospect of a fistful of dollars.</p>

<p>The drift of the current was so strong that before
sunset Matadore had all but vanished, washed away
in the blue that stretched from infinity to infinity,
terrific in its calm.</p>

<p>The Pacific slept, and the slumber of this giant
when sleep takes it in deadly earnest is more trying
to the imagination than its fury and storm, an effect
produced perhaps by the heave of the endless swell
flooding up from nowhere passing to nowhere, through
space and time.</p>

<p>But the crew of the <i>Haliotis</i> were not imaginative
men, and they had other calls upon their consideration.
It was at the first meal on board that the junk began
to whisper of its presence. Harman had brewed
some tea, and they were seated round the table in the
saloon when Davis, looking up from his plate to the
open skylight, sniffed the air.</p>

<p>“That junk whiffs,” said Davis.</p>

<p>It was enough. Harman for a moment turned his
head as though he was straining to listen, and Keller
glanced towards the door, then they went on with
their food, but the mischief was done and from that
on the junk was with them.</p>

<p>It was not so much the badness of the smell as the
faintness and the Chinese nature of it that produced
the psychological effect&mdash;it was a scent, a perfume of
which shark liver oil was the vehicle and the occupants
joss-sticks, opium and the musk of Chinks. It haunted
their sleep that night and was only dispelled when
next morning Keller, who had gone on deck, came
shouting down the hatch that the wind was coming.</p>

<p>They had taken the sails off the junk the night
before, finding a hatchet&mdash;it was stained with something
that was not red paint&mdash;they hacked off the
entangling spar, then, the wind coming, fortunately,
on the junk’s side, the sails of the <i>Haliotis</i> trembled,
the main boom lashed out to port and Davis springing
to the wheel turned the spokes.</p>

<p>For a moment the Chinaman seemed to cling to its
departing companion, wallowed, slobbered, groaned,
and with a last roll dunched in ten feet of the starboard
rail, then it drew away as the great sail pressure
of the <i>Haliotis</i> heeled the schooner to port.</p>

<p>“We’re free,” shouted Harman.</p>

<p>“Hr&mdash;good riddance!” cried Keller, raising his
fist as if to strike at the departing one, now well astern,
and spitting into the water as if to get the taste of her
from his mouth.</p>

<p>Then, as Davis steered and the foam fled astern,
the wind, taking the high poop of the junk, slewed her
round bow towards them, and showing the great
staring, malignant eyes. It was actually as if she
had turned to watch them.</p>

<p>“Look at her!” cried Billy, “turnin’ her snout to
watch us; she’ll follow us now sure as certain, we won’t
have no luck now, we’ll be had somehow or ’nuther,
and maybe over that dope! Bud, where was your
brains you didn’t think of holin’ and sinkin’ her?
Why, if it ain’t anything else we can be had for leavin’
her a-floatin’ derelick and a danger to navigation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Davis, “you and your derelicts.”</p>

<p>The <i>Haliotis</i> was a schooner of some hundred and
twenty tons, and three men can work a schooner of a
hundred and twenty tons across big tracts of ocean if
they have fine weather, if they have no fear, if they
don’t bother to keep a look-out or attend to the hundred
and twenty little duties of ordinary ship life. Harman,
Bud and Keller filled this bill admirably. The wind
changing and blowing from the sou’-east, they ran
before it, ran with no man at the wheel, wheel lashed,
head sheets taut, mainboom guyed to port, and never
a mishap.</p>

<p>They ought to have gone to the bottom, you say;
they ought, but they didn’t. The wind changed
instead, for the Paumotus, though far to the eastward,
still reached them with their disturbing spell breeding
unaccountable influence on wind and weather.</p>

<p>Harman had counted up the sovereigns in the
chamois leather bag&mdash;there were a hundred and twelve.
In a private conference with Davis below, Keller
taking the deck and the wheel, he settled up with
Davis.</p>

<p>“Better split the money now,” said Harman,
“hundred and twelve I’ve got, what’s your?”</p>

<p>“Ninety,” said Davis promptly.</p>

<p>Harman was shocked. He’d reckoned that Davis’s
share was bigger than his own or he wouldn’t have been
so eager to settle up.</p>

<p>“Count ’em,” said he.</p>

<p>Davis produced the knotted handkerchief and
counted the contents. There were only ninety unless
he had subtracted and hidden some, as seemed probable,
for at the rough division when they had split the
coins into two supposedly equal shares, Davis’s had
seemed the bigger.</p>

<p>Harman, pretty sure of this, felt sore; certain of
coming out equal in the deal he had run straight.
However, he settled up without a murmur and
pocketed the bag in a hurry, hearing Keller’s voice
calling for Davis to take the wheel.</p>

<p>Though it was a Spanish ship, to judge by the log,
not a single Spanish or French coin was included in
the ship’s money, indicating that her trade had been
British; papers other than the log there were none;
perhaps the skipper had them on his person when the
Chinks had killed him and hove him to the sharks&mdash;no
one could tell, and the Harman syndicate didn’t
bother.</p>

<p>They had other things to think of. One morning
when all three were on deck, Keller having come up to
relieve Harman at the wheel, the latter, who had been
turning things over in his mind, gave it as his opinion
that the position might be pretty rocky if on striking
the Fijis “one of them d&mdash;&mdash;d British brass-bound
Port Authority chaps” were to turn rusty on the
business. “Suppose we run for Suva,” said he,
“and suppose they say we don’t believe your yarn?
That’s what’s got into my head. Would anyone
believe it? I ask you that, would anyone believe it?”</p>

<p>The others, suddenly struck by this point of view,
ruminated for a moment. No. The thing was true
enough, but it didn’t sound true. They had lifted
the hatch during the calm and found the cargo to be
copra. What was a copra schooner doing seized on
to a Chinaman, everyone dead and all the rest of it?
Stranger happenings had occurred at sea, ships found
derelict with not a soul on board, yet in perfect order&mdash;but
that was no explanation or support for a yarn
that seemed too tough for an alligator to swallow.</p>

<p>Then there was the opium&mdash;suspicion meant search,
and those cans of opium would not help them any;
on top of all there was the money in the pockets of
Bud and Billy, money that even Keller knew nothing
about, but sure to be found on search.</p>

<p>“We ain’t nothing to show,” said Harman. “We
should have kept one of them Chinks for evidence.”</p>

<p>“And how’d we have kept him?” said Davis,
“put him in your bunk maybe&mdash;Why haven’t you
more sense?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it, boys,” said Keller, turning suddenly
from the lee rail where he had been leaning. “Suva&mdash;nothin’.
Opalu’s our port of call, ain’t more than
four hundred miles to the north if our reckonin’s
right. Big German island where the pearl chaps come
for doing business and the Chinks and Malays fr’m
as far as Java and beyond there. <i>Rao Laut’s</i> the name
the Malays give it. Faked pearls and poached pearls
and dope, it’s all the same to them&mdash;they’d buy the
huffs an’ horns off Satan and sell ’em as goat’s. There’s
nothin’ you couldn’t sell them but bibles, and there’s
nothin’ you could sell them they can’t pass on through
some ring or another. I tell you it’s a place, must have
been plum crazy not to have thought of it before.”</p>

<p>“And suppose they ask questions?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“They never ask questions at Rao Laut,” said
Keller. “If there happens to be a doctor there, he
comes aboard to see you haven’t smallpox. If there
isn’t, he doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Keller was right, the big German island was the
spot of spots for them. They wanted no seaboard
ports, no big island ports where English was talked
and questions were sure to be asked. Salving a
derelict in the Pacific means months and maybe
years waiting for your salvage money, especially if
she is a foreigner, that is to say anything that hails from
anywhere that is not the British Empire or America.
They did not want to wait months or years, their lives
were spent in the grip of events, and in even a month
it was hard to say where any one of them might be
from Hull to Hakodate. No, they did not reckon on
salvage money, and they did not want inquiries.
They would have piled her on the Bishop, that great
rock right in their track and south of Laut, only for the
dope. It was impossible to bring those tins into any
port in an open boat.</p>

<p>At Laut it would be easy to get the stuff landed in
one of the canoes or sampans always plying in the
bay&mdash;the only question was a buyer, and Keller said
he would easily find that.</p>

<p>The first they knew of the island was a perfume
of cassi coming through a dawn that having lazily
snuffed out a star or two, simply leapt on the sea;
a crimson and old gold dawn trailed with a smoke
cloud like the fume of joss-sticks, cloud that broke to
form flying flamingoes that were shot to pieces by
sunrays from a sun bursting up into a world of stainless
azure.</p>

<p>The island lay right before them, a high island with
broken reefs to east and west and clear water all to the
south, where beyond the anchorage and the beach lay
the town wherein the four copra traders of Laut
carried on their trade and the Japanese and Chinese
pearl merchants and the Australian and Californian
turtle shell buyers foregathered at the so-called club
kept by Hans Reichtbaum.</p>

<p>In the bay were two schooners, a brigantine and
some small craft at moorings, and somewhere about
nine o’clock the <i>Haliotis</i>, moving like a swan across
the breeze-ruffled blue, dropped her anchor in twenty
fathoms, a far faint echo from the woods following
the rasp of her chain.</p>

<p>That was all the welcome Rao Laut gave her when
Reichtbaum, in pyjamas, shading his eyes on the
club veranda, watched her swing to her moorings and
returned to his breakfast wondering what sort of
customers the newcomers would turn out.</p>

<p>It was their second night at Laut, and Bud and
Billy leaning on the after rail of the <i>Haliotis</i> were
contemplating the lights on shore. A tepid wind
from the sea fanned their cheeks and against the wind
the island breathed at them like a bouquet.</p>

<p>In two days they had taken the measure of the place
and plumbed its resources, and the brain of Keller
working swiftly and true to form had rejected all
possible avenues for opium trade but one&mdash;Reichtbaum.</p>

<p>At the first sight of the German, Keller’s instinct
had told him that here was his man.</p>

<p>Keller had no money to spend on drinks at the club,
and it was Harman’s torture that, with his pocket
bulging with gold, he could not lay out a cent, but
Reichtbaum had stood drinks yesterday, scenting
business from a few words dropped by Keller.</p>

<p>This evening at sundown Keller had gone alone,
taking a single can of opium with him and rowing
himself ashore in the dinghy. Bud and Billy were
waiting for his return. They saw the lights of the
club and the lights of the village winking and blinking,
as the intervening foliage stirred in the wind, then on
the starlit water they saw a streak like the trail of a
water-rat. It was the dinghy.</p>

<p>Keller came on board triumphant and without the
tin. Not a word would he say till they were down
below, then, taking his seat at the saloon table, he let
himself go.</p>

<p>“Look at me,” said he, “sober, ain’t I? Fit to
thread a needle or say ‘J’rus’lem artichoke,’ don’t
you think? And he fired the stuff at me, rum an’
gum and coloured drinks and fizz at the last, but I
wasn’t havin’ any, bisness is bisness, I says, and I
ain’t playin’ a lone hand, I’ve pardners to think of,
‘Plain Sailin’ Jim’s’ my name, and if you don’t pay
two hundred dollars a tin I’ll plain sail off an’ dump
the stuff out.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred dollars!” said the others in admiration.
“You had the cheek to ask him that?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” replied Keller, “and I got it.” He
produced notes for two hundred dollars and spread
them on the table.</p>

<p>“He opened the stuff and sampled it and planked
the money down, and two hundred dollars he’ll pay
for every can, and there’s fourteen of them left, that’s
three thousand dollars for the lot. We’ve only to
take them ashore to get the money. Well now, seems
to me since that’s fixed, we have to think what to do
with the schooner. We don’t want to sit here in this
b’nighted hole twiddlin’ our thumbs and waitin’ to be
took off, more especial as I don’t trust Reichtbaum
any too much, and it seems to me our plan is to stick
to the hooker and take her right to a Dutch port and
sell the cargo, copra prices are rangin’ high&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Steady on,” suddenly cut in Harman. “Why,
you said yourself we couldn’t take her to any port,
seein’ we have no papers but what’s made out in
Spanish, and no crew.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Keller. “It was the crew that was
botherin’ me more than the papers, but how about
a crew of Kanakas now we have the money to pay for
them?”</p>

<p>Davis hit the table with his fist. “By Gosh, there’s
something in that,” said he.</p>

<p>“M’r’over,” said Keller, “I can get six chaps for
five dollars ahead advance. There’s more’n half a
dozen schooner Kanakas kickin’ their heels on the beach
waitin’ for a job. I can get them on board to-morrow,
and all the fruit and water we want for ten dollars to
the chaps that bring it on board. Then, you see, a
copra schooner comin’ into a Dutch port manned by
Kanakas there won’t be no bother. Dutchmen don’t
know Spanish, nor they won’t care, we’re in from the
islands, and we’ve left our Spanish chaps sick at Laut&mdash;if
there’s any questions, which there won’t be.”</p>

<p>“When can we be off?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“To-morrow afternoon, if we’re slick about gettin’
the water and bananas on board,” said Keller. “Then
when we’re all ready for sailin’ we’ll take the dope
cans to Reichtbaum and get the money. We won’t
do that till last thing, for fear he’d play us some trick
or another. I’m none too sure of Germans.”</p>

<p>Next morning at six the work began, Davis and
Harman going ashore to hire the Kanakas and see
about the water and provisions, Keller remaining on
board to clear up the ship and get the fo’c’sle in order.</p>

<p>Boat-loads of fruit were brought off, the newly hired
Kanakas helping, enough bananas to feed them for a
month, taro, bread-fruit and a dozen fowl in a crate,
price three dollars. The water casks were filled, and
by four o’clock, with the promise of a steady wind off
shore, the <i>Haliotis</i>, with canvas raised, was ready to
sail and the crew on board.</p>

<p>Keller had brought up the opium tins in their tarpaulin
wrapper.</p>

<p>“Be sure and count over the dollars,” said he to
Davis, as the cans were lowered into the dinghy, “and
don’t take no drinks from him&mdash;if he gets you on the
booze, we’re done.”</p>

<p>“Him and his booze,” said Harman, as they shoved
off. “Same as if we’re childer&mdash;&mdash;. Lay into it,
Bud.”</p>

<p>The nose of the dinghy grounded on the soft sand,
some native boys helped to run her up, and getting
the cans out, they started up the beach towards the
club.</p>

<p>It was a heavy load, but they managed the journey
without stopping; Reichtbaum was waiting for them
on the veranda and, lending a hand, they brought the
treasure through the bar into a private room at the
back, a room furnished with native made chairs and
tables, a roll-top desk and a portrait of the German
Emperor on the wall opposite the window.</p>

<p>“So,” said Reichtbaum, “that is accomplished.
And now, gentlemen, what will you have to drink?”</p>

<p>“Highball for me,” said Harman, “if it’s all the
same to you. What’s yours, Bud?”</p>

<p>“Same as yours,” said Davis, wiping his mouth
with the back of his hand, and then these worthies
sat whilst Reichtbaum went into the bar and returned
with a syphon of soda and a whisky bottle and then
went out again and returned with three glasses, and
then fishing a cigar-box from a shelf, handed out
cigars.</p>

<p>The syphon whizzed and the fumes of tobacco rose.</p>

<p>Two highballs vanished, and nearly half an hour of
precious time sped with conversation, ranging from
the German Emperor to the morals of the ladies of Laut.</p>

<p>Then Davis turned to reality. “S’pose we get on
with this business of the dope,” said he. “Three
thousand dollars it was, Mr. Keller was saying&mdash;and
we ought to be going.”</p>

<p>He rose from his chair.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Reichtbaum, rising also.
“Three thousand dollars vas agreed. Now for der
dope.”</p>

<p>He took a clasp-knife from his pocket, knelt down
and cut the rope binding the tarpaulin, rooted it open,
put in his hand and produced a tin of bully beef. He
flung the tarpaulin wide and tins tumbled out on the
floor, canned tomatoes mostly&mdash;there was a large
stock of them on the <i>Haliotis</i>. Bud and Billy, petrified
with amazement as Reichtbaum himself, stood without
a word, till Harman found speech.</p>

<p>“Boys, we’re done,” cried Harman. “Fried and
dished by Keller.” He turned, made for the door and
rushed through the bar on to the veranda.</p>

<p>The <i>Haliotis</i> with swelled sails and steered by
“Plain Sailin’ Jim” and his new Kanaka crew was not
only at sea, but far at sea; she had dropped her
anchor chain most likely directly they had vanished
into the club, or maybe even she had taken the anchor
in, Keller cynically sure that falling to drinks, they
would hear nothing of the winch.</p>

<p>“Well, it might have been worse,” said Bud that
night as they sat smoking on the beach. “He’s got
the dope and the cargo and the ship and the crew, but
we ain’t destitute. We’ve got the sovereigns. But
what gets me is the fact that he’ll net all of ten thousand
dollars when he’s sold off that copra and the opium,
to say nothing of the hull. Maybe twenty thousand.
Oh, he’ll do it and strand those poor devils of Kanakas
Lord knows where.”</p>

<p>Harman took out the watch belonging to the captain
of the <i>Haliotis</i> from his pocket, and looked at it
gloomily. Then as a child comforts itself with its
toys, he took the chamois leather bag of sovereigns
from his pocket and began to count over the coins.</p>

<p>“I’m not botherin’ about that,” said he, “what gets
me, is the fac’ that he’s run crooked with us.”</p>

<p>Davis, looking at the coins and remembering the
watch and fountain pen, to say nothing of the coins
in his own pocket, smiled darkly. He was about to
remark that if Keller had run crooked with them,
they had run pretty crooked with Keller, but knowing
the mentality of his companion, he saved his breath
and lit his pipe.</p>

<p>“That’s what gets me,” said Billy, serious as a
deacon and evidently brooding over the sins of the
other and shovelling the sovereigns back into the bag,
“it ain’t the dope he’s diddled us out of, nor the
schooner, which I hopes he’ll bust on a rock, him and
his Kanakas, it’s the fac’ that he’s took me in, in my
opinions. I reckoned that chap was a white man, I’d
a trusted that man with my second last dollar and
wouldn’t have wanted to tie no string to it, neither.
Outspoken and free he was with his conversation and
hidin’ and holin’ in his ways&mdash;’nough to make a chap
bank for the rest of his natural on hearses an’ deaf
mutes. That’s how I’m feelin’. No, sir, it ain’t the
dope he’s diddled us out of, nor the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Davis, and turning on his side
and lighting his pipe, he led the conversation towards
the club, the excellence of its whisky and the morals
of the ladies of Laut.</p>

<h2 id='chVI' title='VI: Pearls of Great Price!'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VI.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>PEARLS OF GREAT PRICE!</span>
</h2>

<p class='ni'>Mambaya is a French island.</p>

<p>Fancy a white French gunboat in a blue,
blue bay, surf creaming on a new moon beach, and a
coloured town tufted with flame trees and gum trees
and rocketing palms. Purple mountains in the
dazzling azure and a perfume of red earth and roses
mixed with the perfume of the sea.</p>

<p>Paumotuan pearl getters haunt Mambaya, brown-skinned
men who have been diving half a year or have
captured in half a day the wherewithal for a spree,
and on the beach when a ship comes in you will find
the Chinese pearl buyers waiting for the pearl men,
cigar coloured girls with liquid brown eyes, the keeper
of the roulette table in Mossena Street and Fouqui,
the seller of oranges, pines, bananas and custard
fruit.</p>

<p>But Mambaya does not exist entirely on pearls.
The island is rich in produce and it is a beauty spot.
Great white yachts drop in and anchor, steamers
bring tourists, and on this same lovely beach where
they used to boil local missionaries in the old days,
you can hear the band playing at night in the Place
Canrobert, where the two hotels are situated and where
at marble-topped tables the tourists are taking their
coffee and liqueurs.</p>

<p>From the island of Laut away down south where
the bad men live, came one day to the beach of Mambaya
two men of the sea, ragged and tanned, with
their pockets stuffed with gold and hungering for
pleasure&mdash;Bud Davis and Billy Harman, no less.</p>

<p>A big Moonbeam copra boat had given them the
lift for the sum of four pounds each, paid in bright
Australian sovereigns, but she could not supply them
with clothes. However, a Jew who came on board
as soon as the anchor was dropped, saved them the
indignity of being fired off the beach by the French
authorities, and, landing in spotless white ducks, they
strung for the nearest bar, swallowed two highballs,
lit two cigars and came out wiping their mouths with
the backs of their hands.</p>

<p>“By golly,” said Billy, “ain’t this prime, Bud?
Look at the place, why it’s half as big as ’Frisco,
innocent lookin’ as Mary Ann and only sufferin’ to be
scooped or painted red.”</p>

<p>They were in the Place Canrobert where the flame
trees grow, where the Kanaka children play naked
in the sun and the shops expose faked Island headdresses
and curios, imitation jewellery from Paris,
canned salmon and Paris hats. The natives of Mambaya
are well-to-do and spend their money freely;
they are paid in dollars, not trade goods, and have a
lively fancy and catholic taste.</p>

<p>“If you’re starting on the painting business,”
said Bud, “then give me notice and I’ll take myself
off to the woods till you’re done, but I’ll warn you this
is no place for painters and decorators. It’s a French
Island and you’ll end your jag with a month in the cells
or road-making.”</p>

<p>“What you wants is a tub and a prayer book,”
said the other, taking his seat at a table in front of
the Café Continental and calling for lime juice.</p>

<p>“Who was talkin’ of jags, and can’t a chap use
a figure of speech without your jumpin’ down his
throat? No, sir, scoopin’ is my idea. Here we are
with our pockets full and our teeth sharp, and if we
don’t pull off a coup in this smilin’ town where the
folks are only standin’ about waitin’ to be took in,
why we’d better take to knittin’ for a livin’, that’s
my opinion.”</p>

<p>A pretty native girl, all chocolate and foulard,
passed, trailing her eyes over the pair at the table;
she wore bangles on her arms and was carrying a
basket of fruit.</p>

<p>“There you are,” said Harman, “if the native
‘Marys’ can dress like that, what price the top folk?
I tell you the place is rotten with money only waitin’
to be took. Question is, how?”</p>

<p>Davis did not answer for a moment, he was watching
an opulent looking American tourist in white drill
who had just left the Island headdress shop across the
way. The tourist opened a white umbrella with a
green inside and passed away towards the sea.</p>

<p>“No-how,” said Davis, “unless you set to work
and open a shop or something, you can’t skin a town
like this same as a pearl lagoon. If you want money
here, you’ll have to work blame hard for it buying
and selling against chaps that are bred to the business
better than you&mdash;that’s civilisation.”</p>

<p>“Dam civilisation!” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Unless,” continued Davis, “you can fake up some
swindle or another&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nothin’&mdash;&mdash;” said Harman, “I’m agin that sort
of game as you ought to know, seein’ you know me.
No, sir, I don’t want no first class ticket to Noumea.
Straight as a gun barrel is what I want to run, but I’ve
no objections to putting a few slugs in the gun. It’s
just crawlin’ into my head that a syndicate is what
we want.”</p>

<p>“And what the devil do you want a syndicate
for?” asked Davis.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way,” said Billy. “A matter
of ten years or so ago in the ’Frisco elections, I was
in with Haffernan, Slungshot Haffernan, the chap
that was tried for the killin’ of Duffy Stevens at San
Leandro which he did, but got off owin’ to an alibi.
Well, I’m tellin’ you. My job was fillin’ the ’lectors
with gin an’ gettin’ them to the polls before they’d
lost the use of their pins and swearin’ false evidence
and such on, which wasn’t what a chap would do only
in ’lection times.</p>

<p>“Well, a month or so after, Haffernan he got
up a syndicate to run a guano island he’d got the
location of and which wasn’t there, and I put fifty
dollars into it and fifty other mugs did ditto and
Haff pouched the coin and turned it over to his wife
and went bankrupt or somethin’, anyhow he had
the coin and we were left blowin’ our fingers. Now
you listen to me. How about that pearl island Mandelbaum
kicked us off? We’ve got the location. How
about sellin’ it to a syndicate?”</p>

<p>“Where’s your syndicate?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Billy, “but it seems to me
it’s to be found for lookin’ in a place like this where
you see chaps like that guy with the white umbrella.
I saw his Siamese twin on the beach when we landed
with a diamond the size of a decanter stopper in his
shirt front and that Jew chap that sold us the clothes
told me there’s no end of Americans come here rotten
with money, to say nothing of Britishers.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Davis, “even supposing you get your
syndicate, what about Mandelbaum? He’s got a
lease of the island and would hoof you and your
syndicate into the sea if you showed a nose in the
lagoon.”</p>

<p>“He said he had a lease,” replied Harman, “but
he never showed a line of writin’ and I believe he was
a liar, but I wasn’t proposin’ to go there, only to sell
the location; if he hoofs the syndicate into the sea,
why, it’s their look-out. If they ain’t fools they’ll
hoof him in first, lease or no lease, and collar the pearls
he’s been takin’.”</p>

<p>“What I like about you is your consistency,” said
Davis.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“The way you stick to your guns. You’re always
preaching that it’s best to run straight and then
you turn up an idea like that. Nice straight sort of
business, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“As straight as a gun barrel,” said Harman enthusiastically.
“You can’t be had no how, not by all
the lawyers from here to Oskosh. Y’see, if chaps
are mugs enough to pay coin down for a location you’re
free to take their coin. That’s good United States
law. I had it from Lawyer Burstall when we got
stung over the Haffernan business. He’s a toughs’
lawyer, long thin chap, not enough fat on him to
grease the hinges of a pair of scissors, and cute enough to
skin Jim Satan if he got a fair grip of his tail.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Davis, “anyhow before you start
in on any of your games, we’ve got to get lodgings.
I’m not going to fling my coin away on one of these
hotel sharps and we’ve got to get some dunnage to
show up with. That Jew chap told me where we could
get rooms cheap, last house end of town on right-hand
side and with a big tree fern in the garden.”</p>

<p>Living is cheap in Mambaya, where people mostly
subsist on coco-nut milk and fried bananas, where you
can get a hundred eggs for half a dollar and a chicken
for a quarter. If you are an æsthete you can almost
live on the scenery alone, on the sun, on the unutterably
blue sky that roofs you between the rains. But Billy
and his companion had little use for scenery, and after
a week of lounging on the beach, wandering about the
town and watching the natives surf bathing off Cape
Huane, life began to pall on them.</p>

<p>They were not fools enough to drink, and if they
had been, the bar of the Café Continental, white-painted,
cold, correct, served by a white-coated bar
tender who could talk nothing but Bêche-de-mer
French, would have choked them off. There was
not the ghost of a sign of a syndicate to be developed,
nor of trade of any sort to be done.</p>

<p>They visited the roulette shop, where the keeper
of the table allowed them to win some forty dollars
which they promptly departed with, never to return.</p>

<p>“We’ve skinned the cream off that,” said Davis
next morning as they lay smoking and kicking their
heels on the sand, “and there’s not another pan of
milk about. You see, we’re handicapped not talking
French. Like cats in a larder with muzzles on&mdash;that’s
about the size of it.”</p>

<p>Harman assented. He took from his pocket the
bag that held his money, nearly a hundred bright
brass-yellow Australian sovereigns. They were on a
secluded part of the beach with no one within eye-shot,
and he amused himself by counting the coins and
stacking them in little piles on the sand.</p>

<p>Then he swept the coins back into the bag and
sat up as Davis pointed seaward to where, rounding
Cape Huane, came a white-painted steamer, the mail
boat for Papeete and beyond.</p>

<p>The whoop of her siren lashed the sleepy air and
brought echoes from the woods and a quarter of a
minute later a far-off whoop from the echoes in the
hills, then down from the town and groves the beach
began to stream with people. Kanaka children racing
for the sea edge and fruit sellers with their baskets,
girls fluttering foulard to the breeze and Kanaka
bucks, naked but for a loin-cloth; then came white
folk, Aaronson, the Jew, and the keeper of the
Hôtel Continental, officials and a stray Chinaman or
two.</p>

<p>Neither Bud nor Billy stirred a limb till the rasp of
the anchor chain came over the water, then getting up,
they strolled down to the water’s edge and stood, hands
in pockets, watching the shore boats putting out,
boats laden with fruit, and canoes with naked Kanaka
children ready to dive for coppers.</p>

<p>Then the ship’s boat came ashore with mails and
passengers.</p>

<p>“Ain’t much sign of a syndicate here, neither,”
said Harman, as he stood criticising the latter, mostly
male tourists of the heavy globe-trotting type and
American women with blue veils and guide books.
“It’s the old mail-boat crowd that’s been savin’
up for a holiday for the last seven year an’s got so in
the habit of savin’, it’s forgot how to spend. I know
them. Been on a mail boat once; haven’t you ever
been on a mail boat, Bud? Then you don’t know
nothin’ about nothin’. Half the crew is stewards
and half the officers is dancin’ masters to judge by the
side of them, and the blessed cargo is duds like them
things landin’ now.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and led the way back towards
the town.</p>

<p>As they drew along towards it, one of the passengers,
a young, smart and natty individual carrying an
imitation crocodile-skin handbag, overtook them,
and Harman, greatly exercised in his mind by the bag,
struck up a conversation.</p>

<p>“Air you goin’ to reside in this town, stranger?”
asked Mr. Harman.</p>

<p>“Eight hours,” replied the stranger, “boat starts
at eight p.m. Smart’s my name, and smart’s my
nature, and not being Methuselah, I find time an object
in life. What, may I ask, is the population of this
town, air there any opportunities on this island and
what’s the condition, in your experience, of the luxury
trades&mdash;may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” said Harman, “ain’t been here long
enough to find out.”</p>

<p>“I got landed to prospect,” went on the other,
“I’m trading&mdash;trading in pearls. O.K. pearls. Wiseman
and Philips is our house and our turnover is a
million dollars in a year. Yes, sir, one million dollars.
From Athabasca to Mexico City the females of forty-two
states and two territories cough up one million
dollars a year for personal adornment, and Wiseman
and Philips does the adorning. I’m travelling the
islands now. Well, here’s a hotel&mdash;and good day to
you, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>He dived into the Continental and Harman and
Davis walked on.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the intrigued Harman, “it sorter
makes one feel alive, comin’ in touch with chaps like
that&mdash;notice the bag he was carryin’, looked as if the
hide’d been taken off a cow that’d been skeered to
death. I’ve seen them sort of bags before on passenger
ships, and they always belonged to nobs. That was a
sure enough panama he was wearin’, and did you notice
the di’mond ring on his finger?”</p>

<p>“He’s a damn fish-scale jewellery drummer,”
said Davis, “out to sell dud pearls and save five dollars
a week out of his travelling allowance, notice he never
offered to stand drinks? The earth’s crawling with
the likes of him, selling servant girls everything from
dud watches to dummy gramophones.”</p>

<p>But Harman was not listening, the million-dollar
turnover, the imitation crocodile skin bag and the
sure enough panama hat had seized on his imagination.</p>

<p>It suddenly seemed to him that he had missed
his chance, that here was the nucleus of the syndicate
he wanted, a sharp, sure-enough American with a big
company behind him and lots of money to burn. He
said so, and Davis laughed.</p>

<p>“Now get it into your head you won’t do more
than waste your time with chaps like those,” said he.
“Of course, they’ve got the money, but even if you
could get to their offices and deal with them instead
of their two-cent drummer, where’d you be? Do you
mean to say you’d have any chance with these sharps,
trying to sell a dud proposition to them? Why,
when they’d took out your back teeth to see if there
was any gold in them and stripped you to your pants,
you wouldn’t have done with them, you’d be stuck
for an atlas of the world, or maybe a piano organ
on the instalment plan, givin’ them sixty per cent.
on the takings and a mortgage on the monkey. You
get me? Sometimes you’re sharp enough, but once
your wits get loose, it’s away with you. This chap
isn’t any use&mdash;forget him.”</p>

<p>But Harman scarcely heard.</p>

<p>If they had turned on their tracks they might have
seen Smart, who, after a drink at the bar of the hotel,
had started out to visit the shops, more especially
those likely to push the sale of O.K. pearls and North
Pole diamonds&mdash;a side line.</p>

<p>At half-past four that afternoon Harman&mdash;Davis
having gone fishing&mdash;found himself in the Continental
bar. The place was empty, and Billy was in the act
of paying and taking his departure when in came
Smart.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” said Harman. “Have a drink?”</p>

<p>They drank. Highballs first of all, and then,
at the suggestion of Billy, who paid for drinks the
whole of that afternoon, hopscotches, which are compounded
of Bourbon, crushed ice, lemon peel, <i>parfait
amour</i> and a crystallised cherry.</p>

<p>At the second hopscotch the tongue of Smart was
loosened and his words began to flow.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon there’s not much to the town,”
said Smart, “but it’s an oleograph for scenery and
pictooresqueness; with a pier for landing and a
bathing beach where all that fishermen’s truck and
those canoes are, it would beat a good many places
on the islands that don’t think five cents of themselves.
I’ve been pushing the name of Wiseman and
Philips into the ears of all and sundry that has got
ears to hear with, but all such places as these is only
seeds by the way. Chicago is our main crop an’
Noo York, after that Pittsburg, and we’re feeling for
London, England.</p>

<p>“We’ve agents in Paris and Madrid that aren’t
asleep, and Wiseman says before he dies he’ll put a
rope of pearls round Mother Earth, and a North Pole
di’mond tiara on her old head. Yes, sir. (Third
hopscotch.) That’s what Wiseman says in his office
and my hearing, and Philips, he helps run the luxury
and fake leather sundry department, he said he’d fit
her out with O de Nile coloured croc leather boots and
a vanity bag of stamped lizard skin if the sales went
on jumping as they were going, which was more like
Klondike stuffed with the Arabian nights than any
sales proposition he had ever heard, seen, dreamt or
read of. Sales! (<i>hic</i>) as sure as there’s two cherries in
this glass I’m holding, my orders booked in Chicago
for pearls ending Christmas Day last was over one
hundred thousand dollars. One hundred thousand
dollars. But you haven’t seen our projuce.”</p>

<p>He bent, picked up his bag, fumbled in it and produced
a box and from the box a gorgeous pearl necklace.</p>

<p>“Feel of those,” said Smart, “weigh them, look at
’em, look at the grading, look at the style, look at the
lustre and brilliancy. Could Tiffany beat them for
twenty thousand dollars? No, sir, he couldn’t;
they leave him way behind.”</p>

<p>The dazzled Harman weighed the rope in his hand
and returned it.</p>

<p>“Don’t be showin’ them sort of things in bars,”
said he, as the other closed the box with a hiccup and
replaced it in the bag, “but now you’ve showed me
yours, I’ll show you mine.”</p>

<p>“Pull ’em out,” said the other, picking up his hat,
which he had dropped in stooping.</p>

<p>“They ain’t here,” said Harman, “it’s only the
knowledge of them I’ve got. Stranger, ’s sure as I’m
lightin’ this cigar, I know a lagoon in an island down
south where you can dredge up pearls same as them
by the fist full.”</p>

<p>“It must be a dam’ funny lagoon,” said the other,
with a cynical laugh.</p>

<p>Harman agreed. It was the funniest place he’d
ever struck, he told the story of it at length and at
large, and how Mandelbaum had kicked him and
Davis off the atoll and how it only wanted a few bright
chaps to hire a schooner and go down and do the same
to Mandelbaum and take his pearls. He assured
Smart that he&mdash;Harman&mdash;was his best friend, and
wrote the latitude and longitude of the pearl island
down on the back of a glossy business card of the
drummer’s, but it did not much matter, as he wrote it
all wrong.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, he was out of the bar and
walking with Smart among palm trees. Then he was
in the native village which lies at the back of the town,
and they were drinking kava at the house of old
Nadub, the kava seller, who was once a cannibal and
boasted of the fact&mdash;kava after hopscotches!&mdash;and
Smart was seated with his arm round the waist of
Maiala, Nadub’s daughter, and they were both smoking
the same cigar alternately and laughing. Nadub
was laughing, the whole world was laughing.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Harman found himself home, trying to
explain to Davis that he had sold the pearl location to
Smart, who was going to marry Nadub’s daughter,
also the beauty of true love, and the fact that he could
not unlace his boots.</p>

<p>“A nice object <i>you</i> made of yourself last night,”
said Davis next morning, standing by the mat bed
where Harman was stretched, a jar of water beside
him. “You and that two-cent drummer! What
were you up to, anyway?”</p>

<p>Harman took a pull at the jar, put his hand under
his pillow and made sure that his money was safe, and
then lay back.</p>

<p>“Up to&mdash;where?” asked Harman, feebly.</p>

<p>“Where? Why, back in the native town. You
left that chap there, and the purser of the mail boat
had to beat the place for him and get four roustabouts
ashore to frog-march him to the ship.”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Harman, “I got along with him in
a bar, and we sat havin’ drinks, them drinks they serve
at the Continental&mdash;Lord, Bud, I never want to see
another cherry again, nor sniff another drop of Bourbon.
I’m on the water-wagon for good and all.
It ain’t worth it; I’m feelin’ worse than a Methodis’
parson. I’m no boozer, but if I do strike the jagg by
accident, my proper feelin’s pay me out. It’s not a
headache, it’s the feelin’ as if a chapel minister was
sittin’ on my chest, and I’d never get him off. Give’s
my pants.”</p>

<p>He rose, dressed, and went out. Down on the
beach the sea breeze refreshed Mr. Harman, and life
began to take a rosier colour. He sat on the sand,
and taking the chamois leather bag from his pocket,
counted the coins in it.</p>

<p>The fun of the day before had cost him ten pounds!</p>

<p>Ten pounds&mdash;fifty dollars&mdash;for what? Three or
four drinks, it did not seem more, and a tongue like
an old brown shoe. He moralised on these matters
for a while, and then returning the coins to the bag
and the bag to his pocket, he rose up and strolled back
through the town, buying a drinking nut from the
old woman at the corner of the Place Canrobert and
refreshing himself with its contents.</p>

<p>Then he wandered in the groves near the native
village, and two hours later, Davis, seated under the
trees of the Place Canrobert and reading a San
Francisco paper, which the purser of the mail boat
had left behind in the bar of the Continental, saw
Harman approaching.</p>

<p>Harman had evidently got the chapel minister off
his chest, his chin was up, and his eyes bright. He
sat down beside the other, laughed, slapped himself
on the right knee and expectorated.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” said Davis.</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” said Harman. “Nothin’ I can tell you
about at the minute. Say, Bud, ain’t you feelin’ it’s
time we took the hook up and pushed? Ain’t nothin’
more to be done here, seems to me, and I’ve got a
plan.”</p>

<p>“What’s your plan?” asked Davis.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s more’n a plan. I’ve been thinkin’ quick
and come to the conclusion that we’ve got to get out
of here, pronto, get me? More’n that, we’ve got to
make for Rarotambu, that’s the German island between
here and Papeete.”</p>

<p>“Why the deuce d’you want to go there?” asked
Davis.</p>

<p>“There’s money waitin’ for us there,” replied
Harman, “and I don’t want to touch at no French
island.”</p>

<p>Davis put his paper behind him and filled a pipe.
He knew that when Harman had one of his mysterious
fits on, there was sure to be something behind it, some
rotten scheme or another too precious to be disclosed
till ripe. But he was willing enough to leave Mambaya
and made no objections.</p>

<p>“How are you going to get down to Rarotambu,”
he asked, “s’posing we decide to go?”</p>

<p>“I’ve worked out that,” said Harman. “You know
that copra schooner that’s been filling up in the bay?
She’s off to ’Frisco, touching at Papeete, leavin’ to-night.
Wayzegoose, he’s her skipper, I met him ten
minutes ago when I was workin’ out my plans, and
he’ll turn aside for us and drop us at Rarotambu for
two hundred dollars, passage money.”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said Davis. “Him and his old cockroach
trap, why, I’d get a passage on the mail boat
for a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Harman, “but I don’t want no mail
boats nor no Papeetes, neither. What are you kickin’
at? I’ll pay.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll come along if you’re set on it,” said Bud,
“but I’m hanged if I see your drift. What’s the
hurry, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind that,” replied Harman, “there’s
hurry enough if you knew. There’s a cable from here
to Papeete, ain’t there?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Well never you mind the hurry till we’re clear of
this place. Put your trust in your Uncle Billy, and
he’ll pull you through. You’ve laughed at me before
for messin’ deals, said I’d no sort of headpiece to
work a traverse by myself, didn’t you? Well, wait
and you’ll see, and if it’s not ‘God bless you, Billy,
and give us a share of the luck’ when we get to Rarotambu,
my name’s not Harman.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Davis, “and maybe not. I’m not
likely to forget that ambergris you fooled me out of
with your plans, nor the dozen times you’ve let me
down one way or another, but I tell you this, Billy
Harman, it’s six cuts with a rope’s end over your
sternpost I’ll hand you if you yank me out of this
place on any wild goose chase.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take ’em,” chuckled Harman. “Joyful, but
there ain’t no geese in this proposition, nothin’ but
good German money, and when you’re down on your
knees thankin’ me, you’ll remember your words.”</p>

<p>“Oh, get on,” said Davis, and taking the newspaper
again, he began to read, Harman making over for the
Continental and a gin and bitters.</p>

<p>The <i>Manahangi</i> was a schooner of two hundred
tons, built in 1874 for the sandal wood trade and
looking her age. Wayzegoose fitted his ship. His
scarecrow figure appeared at the port rail as the boat
containing Billy and Bud came alongside and he
dropped the ladder himself for them.</p>

<p>They had scarcely touched the deck when the
Kanakas clapped on to the winch, the anchor chain
was hove short, the sails set and then, as the anchor
came home, the <i>Manahangi</i>, in the gorgeous light of
late afternoon, leant over to the breeze, the blue water
widened to the shore and the old schooner, ageworn
but tight as a cobnut, lifted to the swell of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>Harman at the after rail gazed on the island scenery
as it fell astern, heaved a sigh of relief and turned to
Davis.</p>

<p>“Well, there ain’t no cables can catch us now,”
said he. “We’re out and clear with money left in
our pockets and twenty thousand dollars to pick up
right in front of us like corn before chickens.”</p>

<p>Wayzegoose, having got his ship out, went down
below for a drink, leaving the deck to the Kanaka
bo’sun and the fellow at the wheel, and finding themselves
practically alone, Harman lifted up his voice
and chortled.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you now,” he said, “I’ll tell you, now
we’re out&mdash;that chap was robbed by the Kanakas.
You remember sayin’ that he was shoutin’ he was
robbed as they was frog-marchin’ him to the ship&mdash;he
spoke the truth.”</p>

<p>“Did you rob him, then?” asked Davis suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll tell you. Him and me was sittin’ drinkin’
at that bar most of the afternoon when out he pulls
pearls from that bag of his, pearls maybe worth
thirty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Where the blazes did he get them from?” asked
Davis.</p>

<p>“Out of that bag, I’m tellin’ you, and right in front
of the Kanaka bar-tender. ‘Put them things away,’
I says, ‘and don’t be showin’ them in bars,’ but not
he, he was too full of Bourbon and buck to listen and
then when I left him after, in the native town, they
must have robbed him. <i>For</i>,” said Mr. Harman,
“between you and me and the mizzen mast, them
pearls are in my pocket now.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t pinch them, but that piece Maiala
did, as sure as Moses wasn’t Aaron, for this morning
I met her carryin’ stuff for old Nadub to make his
drinks with and there round her neck was the pearls.
Stole.</p>

<p>“I follows her home and with sign langwidge and
showin’ the dollars, I made them hand over them
pearls, forty dollars I paid for twenty thousand dollars
worth of stuff and what do you think of that?”</p>

<p>Billy put his hand in his pocket and produced a
handkerchief carefully knotted, and from the handkerchief,
a gorgeous pearl necklace.</p>

<p>Davis looked at it, took it in his hands and looked
at it again.</p>

<p>“Why you double damned idiot,” cried Davis,
“you mean to say you’ve yanked me off in this swill
tub because you’ve give forty dollars for a dud necklace,
and you’re afraid of the police?&mdash;Smart&mdash;why
that chap’s pearls weren’t worth forty dollars the
whole bag full. Ten dollars a hundred-weight’s what
the factories charge&mdash;I told you he was a dud and his
stuff junk&mdash;and look at you, look at you!”</p>

<p>“You’ll be takin’ off your shirt next,” said Harman,
“you’re talkin’ through the hole in your hat. Them
pearls is genuine and if they ain’t, I’ll eat them.”</p>

<p>But Davis, turning over the things, had come
upon something that Harman had overlooked, a
teeny-weeny docket near the hasp, on which could be
made out some figures&mdash;</p>

<p class='ni' style='text-align:center'>$4.50</p>

<p>“Four dollars fifty,” said Davis, and Harman looked.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the figures on the ticket.</p>

<p>“And what was it you gave for them to that girl,
thinking they’d been stolen?” asked Davis.</p>

<p>“Damn petticuts!” cried the other, taking in
everything all at once.</p>

<p>“Six cuts of a rope’s end it was to be,” said Davis,
“but a boat stretcher will do.” He put the trash in
his pocket and seized a boat stretcher that was lying
on the deck, and Wayzegoose coming on deck and
wiping his mouth, saw Harman bent double and meekly
receiving six strokes of the birch from Davis without
a murmur.</p>

<p>And thinking that what he saw was an optical
illusion due to gin, he held off from the bottle for the
rest of that cruise.</p>

<p>So Billy did some good in his life for once in a way,
even though he managed to do it by accident.</p>

<p class='ni'>Captain Brent came down to the Karolin as
she was lying by Circular Wharf, on some
business connected with some gadget or another he
was trying to sell on commission. Some patent dodge
in connection with a main sheet buffer, I think it was&mdash;anyhow,
Dolbrush, the owner and master of the
<i>Karolin</i>, though an old friend, refused to speculate;
the thing to his mind “wasn’t no use to him,” and he
said so without offence to the salesman.</p>

<p>Brent really carried on this sort of business more
for amusement than profit; he had retired from the
sea with enough to live on, and it gave him something
to do of a morning, pottering round the wharves,
boarding ships and boring master mariners, mostly
known to him, with plans and specifications of all
sorts of labour and life saving devices&mdash;he worked for
Harvey and Matheson&mdash;which they might use or
recommend to owners.</p>

<p>He had been, in his time, the finest schooner captain
that ever sailed out of Sydney Harbour, a vast man,
weather-beaten and indestructible-looking as the
Solander Rock, slow of speech but full of knowledge,
and, once started on a story, unstoppable unless by
an earthquake. He had been partner with Slane,
Buck Slane of the Paramatta business; he was Slane’s
Boswell, and start him on any subject he was pretty
sure to fetch up on Slane. He and Slane had made
three or four fortunes between them and lost them.</p>

<p>Putting the main sheet buffer in his pocket, so to
speak, he accepted a cigar, and the conversation moved
to other matters till it struck Chinks&mdash;Chinks and
their ways, clean and unclean, and their extraordinary
methods of money-making; sham pearls, faked
birds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“There’s nothing the Almighty’s ever made that a
Chink won’t make money out of,” said Dolbrush.
“Give ’m a worked-out mine or an old tomato tin and
he’ll do <i>something</i> with it&mdash;and as for gratitude&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you something about that,” cut in Brent.
“I’ve been to school with them, there’s nothing about
them you can tell me right from Chow coffins to imitation
chutney. Why me and Slane hit up against
them in our first traverse and that was forty years
ago. Sixty-one I was yesterday and I was twenty-one
when I fell in with Buck. It don’t seem more than
yesterday. We’d put in to ’Frisco Bay and were lying
at Long Wharf, foot of Third and Fourth Streets.
Buck was Irish, as you’ll remember, a fine strapping
chap in those days, with blue eyes and black hair, and
we’d come from Liverpool round the Horn and we
didn’t want to see the ocean again for a fortnight,
I tell you. Buck had skipped from Tralee or somewhere
or another, and he had forty pounds in his
pocket, maybe he’d got it from robbing a bank
or something, I never asked, but there it was, and
no sooner was the old hooker tied up than he proposed
we’d skip, him and me, and try our luck ashore. I
hadn’t a magg, but he said he had enough for both,
that was Buck all over, and we skipped, never bothering
about our dunnage.</p>

<p>“Buck had an uncle in ’Frisco, well to do and a big
man in Ward politics. O’Brien was his name if I
remember right, and he was reckoned to be worth over
a hundred thousand pounds, so Buck said, but he fixed
to let him lie, not being a cadger; and we got a room
with a widow woman who kept lodgers in Tallis Street
and set out to beat up the town and see the sights.
There were sights to be seen in ’Frisco, those days,
more especial round the dock sides, and the place
was all traps, the crimps were getting from fifty to
seventy dollars a head for able seamen, and most of
the bars and such places were hand in fist with them,
but we steered clear of all that, not being given to
drink, and got home early and sober with our money
safe and our heads straight.</p>

<p>“We’d come to the conclusion that ’Frisco was a
bit too crowded for us, and we fixed to try for the
Islands. Those days there was money out there.
Why, in those days the guano deposits hadn’t been
spotted on Sophia Island, and there it was lying, a
fortune shouting to be took; copra was beginning to
bud, and blackbirding was having the time of its life;
China was eating all the sharks’ fins and <i>bêche de mer</i> she
could stuff, and then you had the shell lagoons, shell
and pearl. ’Frisco was crazy over them, and we
heard yarns of chaps turned millionaires in a night by
striking an atoll and ripping the floor out. They were
true yarns. In those days the Admiralty charts and
the Pacific Directory were years behind the times,
and there were islands being struck time and again
that had never been heard of before.</p>

<p>“We tried round the wharves for a likely ship, but
from Long Wharf to Meiggs’ there was nothing but
grain carriers cleaning their bilges and Oregon timber
schooners unloading pine.</p>

<p>“One day, Buck, who’d been out up town by himself,
came home halooing. ‘Mate,’ says he, ‘our fortunes
are made.’ Then he gave his yarn. He’d been poking
round by China Town when, coming along a street&mdash;Alta
Street it was&mdash;he saw a bunch of Chinks at
a corner, two young chaps and an old father Abraham
of a Chink with horn spectacles on him. They were
standing on the loaf when Buck sighted them, talking,
and then they began quarrelling, and the two young
chaps set on father Abraham and began pulling him
about and kicking him, till Buck sent them flying and
rescued the old chap, who was near done in. Then he
helped him home. Fong Yen was his name, and he
had a little hole of a bird shop just inside China Town
by a Chow restaurant. He was real bad, knocked
about by those brutes, and full of gratitude; he
offered Buck his pick of the birds, but Buck was no
bird fancier. Then says Fong: ‘I’ll give you something
better than birds,’ and he goes to a drawer in
a lacquer box and hunts about and finds a bit of paper.
‘It was given me by my son,’ says he, ‘to keep. He
was killed in the riots down at the docks last month;
you have been as good as a son to me, take it, it’s a
fortune.’ Then he explained. It was the latitude
and longitude of a virgin shell island written down
by his son who’d been a sailor on one of the Chinese
<i>bêche de mer</i> boats. The boat was wrecked and all
hands lost with the exception of this chap, who had
kept the secret and had been saving up money to go
and skin the island when he was killed. Poor old
Fong couldn’t work the thing himself; he had no
relations, and to give or sell that paper to any of the
China Town lot would simply be getting his throat
cut, maybe, to keep his head shut on the matter and
get the purchase money back. He was quite straight
with Buck on this, and told him he was giving him
something that was no use to himself now his son was
dead, but if Buck chose to give him a few dollars to
buy opium with, he wouldn’t be above taking it.
Buck takes out his roll and peels off two ten-dollar
bills and promises him a pull out of the profits.</p>

<p>“Buck showed me the paper. There was nothing
on it but the latitude and longitude of the place and
a spot that looked to me like a blood mark. We got
hold of a chart from a ship master we’d chummed in
with and found the position north-east of Clermont
Tonnerre in the Low Archipelago. I said to Buck,
‘It’s all very well&mdash;but how are we going to get there?
It’s about as much use to us as to the Chink. S’pose
we pull some guy in to put up the dollars for a ship,
do you think he won’t want the profits? If I know
anything of ’Frisco, he’ll want our skins as well. That
old Chink was on the right side of the fence, he knew
’Frisco and knew he hadn’t a dog’s chance of getting
a cent out of it.’ Buck hears me out, then he says,
‘Do you suppose,’ he says, ‘that when I paid out good
money for this thing I had no idea how to work it, do
you suppose I have no man to back me?’</p>

<p>“‘Who’s your man?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘My uncle,’ says he.</p>

<p>“I’d clean forgot the rich uncle. Then I began to
see that Buck wasn’t such a fool as I thought him.
I knew the way the Irish stick together, and old Pat
O’Brien being one of the biggest bugs in the town
I began to see the light, as the parsons say, and Buck
asking me to go with him that night and lay for the
old chap, I agreed.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>“Pat lived on Nobs Hill, and we fixed nine o’clock
as the time to call on him, reckoning he’d be in then
and maybe in a good humour after his dinner. We
easy found the place, for everyone knew Pat, but the
size of it put us off, till Buck took courage at last and
pushed the bell.</p>

<p>“A darkie in a white shirt front opened and showed
us across a big hall into a room all hung with pictures,
and there we sat shuffling our feet till the door opened
again and in come Pat, a little old, bald-headed chap
in slippers with the butt of a cigar stuck up in the corner
of his mouth, more like Mr. Jiggs in the comic papers
than anyone else I’ve seen.</p>

<p>“He never said a word whilst Buck gave his credentials.
Then:</p>

<p>“‘You’re Mary’s son,’ said he. ‘You’ve got her
eyes. How long have you been in this town?’</p>

<p>“‘A fortnight,’ says the other.</p>

<p>“‘Why didn’t you call before?’ asks Pat.</p>

<p>“‘Didn’t like to,’ said Buck. ‘I was hard up and I
didn’t want to cadge on you.’</p>

<p>“‘Why did you call to-night?’ he asks.</p>

<p>“Buck tells him and shows the paper. Pat ordered
in cigars&mdash;we weren’t having drinks&mdash;then he put on
a pair of old spectacles and looks at the paper back
and front.</p>

<p>“Buck puts him wise on the business, and when
the old man had tumbled to it, he asked Buck right
out whether he was crazy to think that a Chink would
give away an oyster shell let alone a shell lagoon,
but when he heard the facts of the matter, and how
Buck had risked being knifed to save Fong being
kicked to death, he came round a bit in his opinions.</p>

<p>“‘Maybe I’m wrong,’ he says, ‘and here’s a spot
of blood on the paper. You haven’t noticed that,
have you? Looks as if the thing had been through
the wars. Well, leave it with me for the night to sleep
on and call again in the morning, and now let’s talk
about the old country.’</p>

<p>“Then the old man sticks the paper in a drawer
and begins to put Buck through his paces. Pat
hadn’t been in Tralee for forty years, but there wasn’t
a street he’d forgotten or a name, and he took Buck
through that town by the scruff of his neck, cross-questioning
him about the shops and the people and
the places, and as he sat there with his old monkey
face screwed up and his eyes like steel gimlets boring
holes in us, I began to understand how he’d come
to be a millionaire; then he got on family matters,
and by the end of the talk he’d come to understand
that Buck was his nephew all right and we lit, promising
to call on him in the morning.</p>

<p>“‘Our fortunes are made,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Wait a bit,’ says I.</p>

<p>“Next morning we were on the doorstep to the
tick and the darkie showed us in.</p>

<p>“‘Well, boys,’ says Pat, coming into the room
dressed to go out, with a plug hat stuck on the back
of his head and the butt of another cigar in the corner
of his mouth. ‘Well, boys,’ says he, ‘you’re up to
time and I’m waiting to meet you on this proposition;
it’s not that I want to be into it,’ he says, ‘but for
the sake of me sister Mary&mdash;God rest her soul&mdash;I’m
going to give you a chance in life. I’m a bit in
the shipping way myself, and I’ve got a schooner
lying off Tiburon waiting for cargo, and I’ll give
you the use of her to run down to the Islands, and,’
says he, ‘if you get the better of that Chink I’ll give
you the schooner for keeps.’</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by getting the better of
him?’ asks Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says Pat, ‘it’s in my mind, thinking things
over, that he’s maybe got the better of you. Maybe
I’m wrong&mdash;but there it is, and how do you like the
proposition?’</p>

<p>“We liked it all right, but he hadn’t finished and
goes on:</p>

<p>“‘Whilst you’re on the job,’ he says, ‘you can take
a cargo for me down to Malakā to Sanderson, a chap
I deal with, and bring back a cargo of copra; you
won’t want any cargo space for pearls, and Malakā
is on your way there or back.’</p>

<p>“We didn’t mind that and said so.</p>

<p>“I’d told Pat I was pretty well up in navigation,
and we all starts out together to look at the schooner,
taking the ferry boat over to Tiburon and Pat giving
us his ideas as we went.</p>

<p>“Us two would be the afterguard, with five or six
Kanakas for crew.</p>

<p>“The <i>Greyhound</i> was the name of the schooner,
and she was lying a bit out from the wharf, and Pat
has the hellnation of a fight with a waterman as to
the fare for rowing us off and back, beats him down
from two dollars to one dollar fifty, and asked Buck
to pay as he hadn’t any change.</p>

<p>“I was thinking it was easy to see how Pat had
become a millionaire till we stepped on the deck of
the Greyhound, and then I had no time to think of
anything but the dirt. It wasn’t dirt you could
sweep off her, it was ground in, if you get me; all the
deck-bears and holystones from here to Hoboken
wouldn’t have made those decks look respectable; it
was like a woman with a bad complexion, even skinning
would be no use.</p>

<p>“‘She’s been in the oil business,’ says Pat.</p>

<p>“‘I can smell it,’ says I, and we goes below after
prodding the sticks and taking notice of the condition
of the standing rigging. Down below it was dirtier,
and the smell rose up like a fist and punched us in
the nose. I don’t know if you’ve ever been below
decks in one of them old Island schooners fitted with
Honolulu cockroaches, and the effulgences of generations
of buck Kanakas and Chinks, to say nothing
of mixed cargoes&mdash;sort of dark brown smell&mdash;but we
weren’t out to grumble, and Pat having showed us
over, we all went ashore and put back for ’Frisco,
Buck paying the fare.</p>

<p>“We parted from Pat on the landing stage, and next
morning the <i>Greyhound</i> was brought over to Long
Wharf for her cargo. It took a fortnight getting the
stuff aboard and hiring the Kanakas. Pat gave us
a diving dress and pump that could be rigged in any
boat; he borrowed them, or got them somewhere
cheap, and then he gave us his blessing and twenty
dollars for ship’s money, and we signed on, me as
master, Buck as mate&mdash;seeing I was the navigator at
a dollar a month, nominal pay&mdash;and six Kanakas as
hands.</p>

<p>“Day before we started we were sitting in the
cabin going over the list of stores when a long, thin
chap by name of Gadgett came on board. He was a
ship’s chandler and when he found no orders he opened
out about Pat, not knowing he was Buck’s uncle,
asking us what screws we were getting and didn’t we
know the <i>Greyhound</i> was condemned, or ought to be,
but that she was certain to be insured for twice her
value, and then he lit.</p>

<p>“When he’d gone I said to Buck: ‘Look here,’
I said, ‘I’m not grumbling, but it seems to me your
uncle doesn’t stand to lose over this game. He’s got
a captain and first officer for nothing. He’s dead
certain we’re on a mug’s game, and he’s used our
cupidity after pearls so’s to make us work for him,
and he not paying us a jitney.’</p>

<p>“‘How do you make that out?’ he asks.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I said, ‘look at him. I reckon, without
disrespect to you, that if there was an incorporated
society of mean men he’d be the President. Did he
even pay you back those dollars he borrowed from
you? Not he. Well, now, do you think if he had
any idea we were going to pull this thing off he wouldn’t
have asked for a share? Course he would. He
didn’t ask, even on the off chance, for if he had we
might have asked for our screws as master and mate.
Another thing. It’s on the charter that we can call
at Malakā on the way out or back; if he had any idea
of us touching this pearl island it’s my opinion he’d
have bound us to call there on the way out.’</p>

<p>“‘Why?’ asks Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Because,’ I says, ‘this cargo of stuff we’ve got
aboard is a darned sight more perishable than the
cargo of copra we’re to bring home; if we strike that
island we’ll be there months and months diving and
rotting oysters with this stuff lying aboard with the
rats and the roaches and weevils working over it.
Do you see? If he had the faintest idea we had a
million to one chance he’d have bound us to call at
Malakā on the out trip. No, he’s just took us for a
pair of chump fools and is working us as such.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, if he has I’ll be even with him,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Another thing,’ I went on, ‘do you remember
he said he’d give you the schooner if you got the better
of that Chink? Those words jumped out of him that
first morning, showing how little he thought of the
business. He never repeated them; afraid of putting
us off. Buck, I’m not saying anything against your
relations, but this old chap gives me the shivers,
him with a million of money in the Bank of California
and you with nothing, and him using you. It’s not
me I’m thinking of, but you, Buck.’</p>

<p>“‘Never mind me,’ says Buck.”</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>Dolbrush produced drinks and Brent, having refreshed
himself and lit a new cigar, proceeded.</p>

<p>“Well, I was telling you&mdash;next morning we howked
out and by noon that day we were clear of the bar,
taking the sea with the Farallones on the starboard
beam and all plain sail set. The <i>Greyhound</i> was no
tortoise, and for all her dirt she was a dry ship, but that
day when we came to tackle the first of the ship’s
stores we’d have swapped her for a mud barge and
penitentiary rations. Pat must have got the lot
as a present, I should think, to take it away. I never
did see such junk; it wasn’t what you might call
bad, but it was faded, if you get me; not so much
stinkin’ as without smell to it&mdash;or taste.</p>

<p>“‘All shipowners are bad, and Pat’s a shipowner,’
I says, ‘but there’s no doubt he’s given you a chance
in life for the sake of his sister Mary&mdash;God rest her
soul&mdash;the chance of getting ptomaine poisoning if
you don’t die first of jaw disease breaking your teeth
over this damn bread.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll be even with him yet,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“We did some fishing, for we had tackle on board,
and that helped us along over the line, and one morning
twenty-seven days out from ’Frisco we raised an
outlier of the Marqueses. Coming along a week later
we raised the spot where pearl island ought to have
been&mdash;we’d labelled it Pearl Island before sighting it,
and that was maybe unlucky&mdash;anyhow, there was no
island to meet us at noon that day and no sign of one
inside or outside the horizon.</p>

<p>“‘That Chink sold you a pup,’ says I to Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Maybe it’s your navigation is at fault,’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Maybe,’ says I, wishing to let him down gentle,
but feeling pretty sure the navigator wasn’t born
that could find that island.</p>

<p>“We stood a bit more to the south with a Kanaka
in the crosstrees under a reward of ten dollars if he
spotted land that day, and towards evening the wind
dropped to a dead calm and we lay drifting all that
night, the wind coming again at sun up and breezing
strong from the south west.</p>

<p>“We put her before it, both of us pretty sick at
thinking how Pat was right and how he’d landed us and
used us for his purpose. We weren’t mean enough dogs
to think of spoiling the cargo or piling the schooner;
we just took our gruel, fixing to lay for him with our
tongues when we got back, and as for the Chink, well.
Buck said he’d skin that Chink if he had to bust up
China Town single-handed to do it.</p>

<p>“He was talking like that and it was getting along
for eight bells, noon, when the Kanaka look-out
signals land, and there it was right ahead, but nothing
to be seen only a white thumb-mark in the sky from
the mirror blaze of a lagoon.</p>

<p>“Then the heads of cocoanut trees poked up all
in a row, and I turns to Buck and we gripped hands.</p>

<p>“‘It’s a hundred and more miles out,’ said I,
‘but I reckon it’s not the island that’s out but me and
my navigation; that old Chink was no liar. It’s the
Island. Must be, for there’s nothing on the chart
for five hundred miles all round here.’</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” said Buck.</p>

<p>“We held on steady, and then the reef began to show,
and coming along presently we could hear the boom
of it. We couldn’t see a break in it, and getting up
close we shifted our helm a bit and came running along
the north side, the gulls chasing and shouting at us,
the reef foam dashing away only a hundred yards
to starboard, and the wind that was filling our sails
bending the cocoanut trees.</p>

<p>“I felt like shouting. We could see the lagoon,
flat as a looking-glass over beyond the reef that was
racing by us; then we came on the break, and putting
out a bit we came in close hauled with no tumble
at the opening seeing it was slack water.</p>

<p>“It was a fairish big lagoon, maybe four miles by
six or so, and since the Almighty put the world together
you’d have said we were the first men into it. It
had that look. Not a sign of a native house; nothing
but gulls. It was fifty-fathom water at the break&mdash;made
deep by the scouring of the tides; then it
shoaled up to twenty and ten, and we dropped the hook
in seven-fathom water close on to the northern beach.
Not a sign of an oyster. The floor just there was like
a coloured carpet with coral, and the water was so
clear that every coloured fish that passed had a black
fish going along with it&mdash;which was its shadow.</p>

<p>“We dropped the boat and pulled off, and we hadn’t
got two cable lengths to the west of where the <i>Greyhound</i>
was lying when we struck the beds, acres of
them.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the Sooloo fisheries and the Australian,
but I reckon the Pearl Island oysters could have
given them points as to size. Somewhere about six
hundred pairs to the ton they ran, and that’s a big
oyster.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said Buck, ‘here we are and here we
stick. We’ve anchored on top of a fortune and if it
takes ten years we’ll hive it.’ That was all very well
saying, but we’d got the question of grub to consider,
but we soon found we needn’t worry about that;
there was fish and turtle and <i>béche de mer</i> and cocoanuts,
bread-fruit on the south side and taro, to say
nothing of oysters. Having fixed that matter, we set
to work. Those Kanakas hadn’t signed on for diving
after oysters, but stick a Kanaka in the water and it’s
all he wants; besides, we gave them extra pay in the
way of stick tobacco, axing open a lot of old Pat’s
tobacco cases, sure of being able to pay him out of the
pearl money; then we worked like grigs in vinegar,
and at the end of the first week’s work we hadn’t found
one pearl. The way we did was to put each day’s
takings out on the beach in the sun; the sun opened
them better than an oyster knife.</p>

<p>“‘Well, this is bright,’ says Buck one day as we
were going over the heap. ‘Luck’s clean against us,’
he says, and no sooner had he spoke the words, a
whopper of a pearl ’s big as a pistol bullet jumped
into his fist out of an oyster he was handling. It
wasn’t a big oyster neither. My, that pearl was a
beauty; it turned the scale at forty grains I reckon,
and it wasn’t the last.</p>

<p>“We were six to seven months on that job, and I
never want to strike another pearl lagoon. Me and
Slane had at last to do most of the diving, for the
Kanakas got sick of it. We looked like Guy Fawkes.
When we sailed into that lagoon we were spry young
chaps clean-shaved and decently dressed; when it
had done with us we were bearded men, men black with
the sun and salt water and ragged as Billy be Dam.
I tell you we were spectacles. Satan never fixed up
such a factory as a pearl lagoon when you have to
work it short-handed and on the secret. You can’t
stop, not if you only get a pearl in a thousand oysters,
you can’t stop. It’s always the one pearl more that
does you. It’s like the gambling rooms. Till one day
I says to Buck: ‘I’m done.’</p>

<p>“‘I was only waiting for you to say it,’ said Buck.
‘I’ve been done this last week only I wouldn’t give in.’</p>

<p>“We’d got together two hundred and thirty-two
pearls and some seeds&mdash;the king of the lot was a roseleaf
pink pearl; there were two golden pearls that were
a perfect match pair, half a dozen blacks, a few
yellow that weren’t no use, and the balance white.
We’d been looking up prices before we started and
got some tips from a man who was in the know, and
we reckoned our haul was thirty or forty thousand
dollars. You see it was virgin ground, and the things
had time to grow to size without being disturbed.</p>

<p>“I ought to have told you the diving dress was no
use. Pat had got it from some old junk shop or
another, and the pump was as bad, but the water
being shallow it didn’t matter much, though if the
thing had been in order we’d have got the job through
a couple of months earlier.</p>

<div class='secn'>IV</div>

<p>“We lit from that place never wanting to see an
oyster again, and leaving tons of shell on the beach
worth, maybe, five to six hundred dollars a ton.
We didn’t want it. We laid our course for Malakā
and raised it ten days later, a big brute of a copra
island with Sanderson in pyjamas on the beach and
a schooner loading up in the lagoon. He didn’t want
Pat’s cargo, said it was four months overdue, and
he had cleared the last of his copra and had enough
trade to carry on with. We didn’t mind, seeing our
contract was to call there out or back with no time
limit specified, and we were mighty glad Pat had been
done in the eye, seeing how he’d served us. There
was nothing to do but cart the stuff back to ’Frisco,
and dropping Malakā, we made a straight run of it,
raising the Farallones in twenty-eight days and laying
the old hooker off Tiburon without a spar lost or a
scratch on her.</p>

<p>“I said to Buck: ‘What are you going to give
that Chink? You promised him a suck of the orange,
didn’t you?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m going to give him a thousand dollars,’ said
Buck, ‘when I’ve cashed the pearls and settled with
Pat. I’m a man of my word, and there’s no luck in
breaking a promise.’</p>

<p>“I was with him there.</p>

<p>“We landed with the stuff in a handkerchief and
made straight for Patrick O’Brien’s business office.
We’d cleaned ourselves a bit, but we still looked pretty
much scarecrows, but when we’d shown that handkerchief
of pearls to the old man he didn’t bother
about our looks.</p>

<p>“I told him how, through my bad navigation, we’d
missed the island at first, and then struck it by chance.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says Pat, ‘you’re the only men in ’Frisco
that’s ever got the better of a Chink so far as to get
something out of him for nothing, for twenty dollars
is nothing against that hatful of pearls. The schooner
is yours, Buck, and from what I hear of the cargo
you can dump it in the harbour or sell it for junk.’</p>

<p>“Then when we’d cleaned ourselves and got some
decent clothes, he took us off to the Palatial and gave
us a big dinner. Now that chap was the meanest
guy in small things you could find in California, yet
he’d lost a cargo and a schooner and instead of cutting
up rough he seemed to enjoy it. Buck being his
nephew, I suppose he was proud of being done by him
and seeing him successful.</p>

<p>“The next day, having cashed in half the pearls.
Buck says to me: ‘Come on,’ he says, ‘and we’ll
settle up with father Abraham.’</p>

<p>“Off we starts and gets to the place, and there was
the bird shop sure enough beside a Chow restaurant,
but there was no father Abraham.</p>

<p>“A young Chink was in charge, and when Buck
asks for Fong Yen he said there was no such person.
Then he seemed to remember, and said that Fong had
sold the shop and gone back to China.</p>

<p>“‘Why, that’s him inside there,’ said Buck, and
makes a dive into the shop, but there was no one
there. Fong must have done a bunk through a back
door or something&mdash;anyhow he was gone.</p>

<p>“Then all of a sudden there comes up a big master
mariner looking man along the street, drops anchor
before the bird shop and calls out asking for Ming
Lu. The young Chink came out and asks what he
wants, saying there was no such person as Ming Lu.</p>

<p>“‘Say, brother,’ says Buck, jumping at the truth,
‘was Ming Lu, by any chance, an old gendarme in
spectacles?’</p>

<p>“‘He was,’ says the crab, and then he spun his
story. He’d been walking along Alta Street three
months ago when he saw three Chinks at a corner,
an old boob in spectacles and two young ones. As
he came up with them they started quarrelling, pulling
the old chap about and kicking him cruel, and Blake,
that was the guy’s name, started in like a whole-souled
American to save the antiquity from ruin.</p>

<p>“He helped Ming back to his bird shop, and the old
chap near drowned him in gratitude, and gave him a
chart of a pearl island his son, that had been murdered
in a tong dust-up the month before, had discovered
when a sailor in one of the Chinese <i>bêche de mer</i>
boats, that had been wrecked, with all hands lost but
his precious son.</p>

<p>“Blake gave him ten dollars to buy opium with,
and being a schooner owner, lost three months hunting
for that island which wasn’t there.</p>

<p>“It was the same island that had been wished on
us&mdash;Buck pulled out his chart and they compared&mdash;exactly
the same, spot of blood and all. The things
must have been lithographed by the dozen and Lord
knows how many mugs had fallen to the gratitude trap;
which no one but a Chink could ever have invented,
if you think over the inwards and outwards of it.</p>

<p>“Then Buck told out loud so that Fong, if he was
listening, could hear, how we had fallen on a pearl
island, by chance, and how, thinking it was bad navigation
that had made us out in our reckonings, he was
bringing a thousand dollars to Fong as a present out
of the takings according to promise. Then he pulls
out his roll and gives the thousand dollars to Blake
as a make up. The young Chink ran in at the sight
of this, and, as we walked off arm in arm for drinks,
I heard sounds from the upper room of that bird shop
as if Fong was holdin’ on to something and trying not
to be sick.</p>

<p>“Then as we were having drinks the question came
up in Buck’s head as to whether he was entitled to
that schooner seeing that Fong had managed to get
the better of him at the go off. He put it to Blake,
and Blake, who was a great chap for backing horses
when ashore, says: ‘Go off be damned,’ he says.
‘It’s the finish that matters. You did him on the post,’
he says&mdash;and we concluded to leave it at that.”</p>

</h2>

<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>There is good fishing to be had round Sydney
way, yellow-tail and schnapper and green
backed sea bream; jew-fish and mullet and trevalli.
You can fish at low tide in the pools or you can fish
from a boat, beaching her for the night in one of the
coves and camping out under the stars, with the
scent of the gums mingling with the scent of the
sea, and the song of the waves for lullaby.</p>

<p>Over Dead Man’s Cove and its beach of hard sand
the cliff stands bluff and humped like a crouching
lion, and there one night the year before last old
Captain Brent and I were kicking our heels and
smoking after supper and passing in review the
day’s work and the tribes of the sea.</p>

<p>Brent was a keen fisherman, and there were few
waters he did not know, and few fish he hadn’t taken
one time or another. He had always travelled with
his eyes open, and his natural history was first hand
and his views fresh as originality itself. He said
crabs could think, instancing certain hermit crabs
that always chose protective-coloured shells, and
that not only did sword-fish fight duels&mdash;I knew
that, for I had seen it myself&mdash;but that there were
tribal wars carried on in the sea, international
struggles so to speak, between the nations of the fishes.</p>

<p>“If fish didn’t kill fish,” said the Captain, “the
sea would be solid with mackerel inside two years,
to say nothing of herring. Haven’t you ever thought
of what keeps them down? It’s the Almighty,
of course, but how does He work it? Lots of folk
think He works it by making the fish eat the fish just
because they are hungry. That’s one of His ways,
but another is just war for war’s sake, or for the
sake of the grouch one tribe keeps up against another.
You see, it’s a bit unfortunate, seeing that if the
herring once got above a certain number all the
eating in the world wouldn’t stop them from turning
the sea solid with herring, so the Almighty has fixed
His killing machine with two blades, one that kills
for the sake of food and the other for the sake of
killing.</p>

<p>“It’s the same with the tribes of men, I reckon,
only with them there’s only one blade left, since they
don’t kill each other nowadays for the sake of
food.</p>

<p>“There’s something in one tribe that makes for
war against another tribe. You may boil them
but you won’t get it out of them. I’ve seen it. You’d
have seen it too if you’d traded among the Islands
in the old days, selling Winchesters to the natives
to prosecute their wars with, and I’ll give you a
case in point.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you how me and Slane pulled off that
pearling job, but I never told you what we did with
the money. Most chaps would have bust it, we
just stuck it in the bank and, after a run to the
Yosemite, back we come to ’Frisco on the look out
for more larks. We weren’t set on money for the
sake of money so much as for the fun of getting it,
for I tell you as a mortal truth there’s no hunting to
beat the hunting of a dollar, more especial when
you’ve got a herd of twenty or thirty thousand of
them with their tails up and you after them. We’d
had enough of pearling, we had no taste for blackbirding
and we were turning copra over in our minds
when, sitting having our luncheon one day in Martin’s
restaurant, a slab-sided Yank, six foot and over
and thin as a Jackstaff, comes along up to us.</p>

<p>“‘You’re Mr. Slane?’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘That’s me,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve heard tell of you,’ says the chap, ‘and
I’ve got a double-barrelled proposition to put before
you. May I take a seat at your table? Scudder’s
my name, and Martin will tell you I’m a straight
man.’</p>

<p>“Down he sits. We’d finished feeding and so had
he; the place was pretty empty and no one by to
hear, and he begins.</p>

<p>“‘First barrel of the prop,’ he says, ‘is a dodge
for killing fish. You know how they fish out in the
Islands? Well, they do a good deal of spearin’ and
hookin’ and sometimes they poison the fish pools
with soap, but the king way is dynamite.’ He pulls
a stick of something out of his pocket and goes on.
‘Here’s a stick of dynamite. You can fire it by
electricity or you can shove a match on one end and
light it and throw the durned thing into the water.
It goes bang and a minute after every fish in that
vicinity come to the surface stunned dead. That’s
so, but the bother is the stuff goes off sometimes
premature and the Kanakas are always losing hands
and legs and things, which don’t make for its
popularity. Being out there last year at Taleka
Island I set my invention trap working to hit a device.
I’ve always took notice that a man who fills a want
fills his pockets, and a patent safety explosive fish
killer is a want with a capital “W” right from ’Frisco
to Guam. Well, here it is,’ he says, and out of his
other pocket he takes the great-grandfather of a
Mills bomb, same as the Allies have been pasting the
Germans with. It wasn’t bigger than a tangerine
orange and rough made, but it had all the essentials.
You didn’t pull a pin out, it was just two caps of
metal screwed together. The thing was dead as
mutton when it was lightly screwed, but screwed
tight it exposed its horns and was live as Satan.
Just one turn of the wrist tightened it up and then
if you flung it against anything, even water, it would
go bang. It was a working model, and he showed us
the whole thing and the cost of manufacture. His
factory was a back bedroom in Polk Street, but he
reckoned with a shed and a lathe and a couple of
Chink artisans to help he could turn out fifty Scudder
Fish Crackers&mdash;that’s the name he gave them&mdash;a
day. He said the Bassingtons had a share in the
patent and would give him the material for nothing
so as to have the thing tried out. He wanted five
hundred dollars to start his factory, then he wanted
us to give him an order for two thousand crackers
at fifty cents each.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t want no more cargo than that,’ said
he, ‘once the Kanakas get the hang of this thing
they’ll trade you their back teeth for them; you
see it’s new. It’s like millinery. If I could invent
a new sort of hat and start a store in Market Street
every woman from here to St. Jo would be on it in
a cluster. You could scrape them off with a spoon.
Kanakas are just the same as women, for two thousand
of them crackers you can fill up to your hatches
in copra.</p>

<p>“‘Well, now,’ he goes on, ‘on top of that I’ll make
you a present of three thousand dollars, if you’ll
take the proposition up. Sru, the chief chap at
Taleka, wants Winchester rifles and ammunition
and he’s got the money in gold coin to pay for them.
He wants six thousand dollars’ worth and I can get
the lot from Bassingtons for three thousand dollars,
boxed and laded on board your ship. The crackers
won’t take no room for stowage and the guns and
cartridges won’t eat half your cargo space, so you
can take some cheap trade goods that’ll give you a
deck cargo of turtle shell and <i>bêche de mer</i>. Get me?
You make money on the crackers, you make money
on the guns and you make a bit out of the shell.
It’s a golden goose layin’ eggs at both ends and the
middle, and I’ll give you a writing promising to pay
the five hundred dollars for the factory in one year
with twenty per cent, for the loan.’</p>

<p>“I could see Slane was sniffing at it so I didn’t
interfere, and the upshot was we made an appointment
with Scudder to meet us next day and take
a boat out in the harbour to test a couple of his
crackers. We did, and he was no liar, the things
went off like guns and dead fish were still coming
up when a police boat nailed us and rushed us ashore
and we had to pay ten dollars fine for illegal behaviour.
That’s what the Yanks called it&mdash;anyhow the dead
fish settled the business and Slane took up the proposition
and put his hand in his pocket and fetched
out the money to start the factory and gave Scudder
his order for two thousand crackers.</p>

<p>“Slane hadn’t disposed of the <i>Greyhound</i>. We
ran her into dock and had the barnacles scraped
off her, gave her some new spars and a new mainsail
and finished up with a lick of paint. It took
six weeks and by that time Scudder had finished his
job and had the crackers ready boxed and all and
the Bassington company were waiting to deliver
the Winchesters and ammunition. We took the
old hooker over to Long Wharf for the stowing and
the stuff came down in boxes marked eggs and
crockery ware.</p>

<p>“They were pretty sharp after gun-runners in those
days, but Scudder fixed everything somehow so that
none of the cases were opened. We got the cracker
boxes on first and then stowed the guns and cartridges
over that, and on top of the guns some trade goods,
stick tobacco and rolls of print and such, six Chinks
we took for a crew and a Kanaka by name of Taute
who could speak the patter of most of the Islands,
and off we started.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>“Taleka is an outlier of the New Hebrides, a long
run from ’Frisco, but we never bothered about time
in those days. We never bothered about anything
much. We hadn’t been out a week when I said one
night to Slane, ‘Buck,’ said I, ‘s’pose one of those
crackers took it into its head to go off, being screwed
too tight?’ ‘If it did,’ said Buck, ‘the whole
two thousand would go bang and the cartridges would
follow soot; if one of them crackers fructified before
its time next minute you’d be sitting on a cloud
playing a harp, or helping stoke Gehenna, don’t
make any mistake about that.’ We left it so. We
never bothered about anything those days as long
as the grub was up to time and not spoiled in the
cooking.</p>

<p>“We touched at Honolulu and had a look round
and then we let out, passing Howland and the Ellices,
raising Taleka forty-five days out from ’Frisco.</p>

<p>“It’s a big brute of a high island and away to
s’uth’ard of it you can see Mauriri, another big island
forty-five or fifty miles away.</p>

<p>“There’s no reef round Taleka, but there are reefs
enough to north and west and a big line of rock
to s’uth’ard that doesn’t show in calm weather, only
now and again when the swell gets too steep and then
you’ll see an acre of foam show up all at once.
Rotten coast, all but the east side, where a bay runs
in between the cliffs and you get a beach of hard sand.</p>

<p>“We dropped anchor in twenty-five fathoms close
to the beach. There were canoes on the beach, but
not a sign of a native; the cliffs ran up to the sky either
side, with the trees growing smaller and smaller, and
out from near the top of the cliff to starboard a
waterfall came dancing down like the tail of a white
horse and that was all; there was no wind scarcely
ever there and the water between the cliffs was like
a black lake. I tell you that place was enough to
give you the jim-jams, more especial when you knew
that you were being watched all the time by hundreds
of black devils ready to do you in.</p>

<p>“We fired a gun and the echoes blazed out like a
big battle going on and then fizzled off among the
hills where you’d think chaps were pot-shotting
each other. Then the silence went on just as if it
hadn’t been broken, and Slane, who’d got a pretty
short temper when he was crossed, spat into the
harbour and swore at Sru.</p>

<p>“Then he ordered up a case of guns and a box
of ammunition, and he and me and Taute rowed
ashore with them, beaching the boat and dumping
the guns and ammunition on the sand.</p>

<p>“We took the guns out of the case and laid them
out side by side same as if they’d been in a shop
window, then we opened the ammunition box and
exposed the cartridges.</p>

<p>“It was a sight no murder-loving Kanaka could
stand and presently out from a valley a bit up beyond
the anchorage comes a chap with the biggest belly
I’ve ever seen on one man. He had slits in his
ears and a tobacco pipe stuck through one of the
slits, nothing on him but a gee string and eyes that
looked like gimlet holes into hell. I never did see
such a chap before or since. It was Sru himself, and
he was followed by half a hundred of his tribe, every
man armed with an old Snider or a spear, or sometimes
both.</p>

<p>“I saw Taute shivering as he looked at Sru, then
he bucked up and took heart, seeing that Sru wasn’t
armed and was coming for guns, not fighting.</p>

<p>“Then the palaver began, the Kanakas squatting
before the gun cases and Slane showing them the Winchesters
whilst Taute did the talking. Scudder had been
there all right the year before and had measured up
Sru and his wants and his paying capacity to a T.
He had the gold, brass-yellow Australian sovereigns
and British sovereigns got from God knows where,
but sovereigns right enough with Victoria’s head
on them, for he showed us a fistful, and it was only
a question of whether Sru would pay six thousand
dollars for our cargo. He wanted to make it four,
then he gave in, and we put back in the boat to have
the stuff broken out of the hold.</p>

<p>“Knowing the sort of chap Sru was we ought to
have made him bring the money on board before a
single case was landed, but we were young to the
trade and too straight to think another chap crooked,
so we didn’t. We let the canoes come alongside and
there we hung watching naked Kanakas all shiny
with sweat handing overboard the boxes, six guns
to a box, to say nothing of the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>“We put off with the last case and then we sat
waiting on the beach for our money.</p>

<p>“The Kanakas with the last of the cases turned
up into the valley, and when they were gone you
couldn’t hear a sound in that place but the noise of
the waterfall up among the trees and now and then
the sea moving on the beach.</p>

<p>“The water came into that bay as I’ve never seen
it come anywhere else. It would be a flat calm,
and then, for no reason at all, it would heave up and
sigh on the sand and fall quiet again like the bosom
of a pious woman in a church.</p>

<p>“There we sat waiting for our money and watching
the <i>Greyhound</i> as she swung to her moorings with
a Chink fishing over the rail.</p>

<p>“‘What do you think of Sru,’ says Buck at last.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I don’t think he’s a beauty,’ I says,
and then talk fizzled out and there we sat waiting for
our money and chucking stones in the water.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you there were canoes on the beach
when we came in, but after the guns had been brought
ashore the canoes had been taken round the bend of
the bay, and as we sat there waiting for our money
there was no one on that flat beach but our two
selves and the Chink who’d helped us to row ashore,
the boat was beached close to us and only waiting to
be shoved off.</p>

<p>“I says to Buck, ‘Say, Buck,’ I says, ‘suppose
old Johnny Sru takes it into his woolly head to stick
to the dollars as well as the guns, what are you going
to do then?’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t be supposing things,’ says Buck. ‘Sru’s
no beauty, maybe, but he’s a gentleman. All savages
are gentlemen if you treat them square.’</p>

<p>“‘Where did you get that dope from?’ I asks
him.</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ he says, ‘I don’t know,’ he says, ‘one place
or another, but mainly from books.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I says, ‘I’m not much given to book reading,
but I hope you’re right, anyway.’</p>

<p>“No sooner were the words out of my mouth
than the Chink by the boat gives a yell. I looked
up and saw a big rock skipping down hill to meet
us. It wasn’t as big as a church, but it seemed to
me, looking up, there was many a Methodist chapel
smaller; shows you how the eyes magnify things
when a chap’s frightened, for it wasn’t more than
ten ton all told judging by its size when it hit the
target.</p>

<p>“It missed us by six foot and hit the Chink. We
couldn’t get him out from under it seeing he was
flattened as flat as a sheet of paper and we hadn’t
more than got the boat pushed off when down came
another and hit the place where we’d been sitting
waiting for our money and talking of all savages
being gentlemen if you treated them square.</p>

<p>“The chaps above have got the range, but they
weren’t wasting ammunition, for as soon as we lit
the firing ceased.</p>

<p>“I never did see a chap in a bigger temper than
Buck. He went white, and when an Irishman goes
white, look out for what’s coming.</p>

<p>“We got aboard and got the boat in, and then we
took our seats on the hatch combing and had Taute
along for a council of war.</p>

<p>“Taute had chummed up with Sru’s men and a
couple of the Marys whilst the unloading was going
on, and he’d found out that Sru wanted the guns
for an attack on Mauriri, the big island to the s’uth’ard.</p>

<p>“Tiaki was the chief man on Mauriri, and he
and Sru had been at it for years, the two islands
hitting each other whenever they could, sinking
fishing canoes and so on, but never a big battle.
They were too evenly matched and knew it. But
those Winchesters would make all the difference, so
Taute said and we didn’t doubt him.</p>

<p>“Buck, when he’d sucked this in, sits biting his
nails. The sun had set by now and the stars were
thick overhead and it came to the question of getting
out against the breeze and tide or sticking till the
morning when the land wind would give us a lift.
Taute gave it as his opinion we’d be safe enough for
the night. Sru didn’t want our ship, and the Kanakas
had got it into their thick heads that when a ship
was raided and the crew murdered in those parts,
somehow or another, a British cruiser would turn
up maybe months later and make trouble, which was
the truth. So we let the anchor lie in the mud and
we sat down to supper that night as calm as if we
weren’t sitting on a hive of hornets that any minute
might let out with their stings.</p>

<p>“Middle of supper, Buck hits the table a welt
with his fist.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got the blighter,’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Who?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘Sru,’ says he. ‘I’ve got him by the short hairs
and if I don’t make him squeal, my name’s not Buck
Slane.’</p>

<p>“I didn’t see his meaning, and said so, telling him
straight out that we’d better take our gruel and let
Sru alone, that we’d been fools to let him have the
stuff without the cash brought on to the beach and
that we’d only get broken heads by trying to fight
him.</p>

<p>“‘I ain’t going to fight him,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Who is, then?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘Tiaki,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“‘That chap over at Mauriri?’ I questions.</p>

<p>“‘The same,’ says him.</p>

<p>“‘But look here,’ I says, ‘how in the nation are
you going to ginger him up to fight Sru seeing that he’s
been holding off for years and seeing that Sru has
got those Winchesters? What would he fight him
with?’</p>

<p>“‘Fish crackers,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“That hit me on the head like an apple. I’d
got the durned things so connected with fish in my
mind that I’d clean forgot to think that they could
be used against humans, more especial by Kanakas
used to throwing spears and things all their lives.
Then Buck opens up his plan which was simple
enough. It would take Tiaki’s men eight or ten
hours paddling in their canoes to reach Taleka. If
they started at four o’clock in the afternoon they’d
make the island by two next morning, then, crawling
up that valley they could fall on Sru’s village and
bomb it to pieces before daybreak. Bloodthirsty,
wasn’t it? But Buck was out for blood, the Irish
was raised in him and he didn’t care a cent what
happened or what he paid so long as Sru got his gruel.</p>

<p>“‘But look here,’ I said, ‘it’s all very well talking,
but Winchesters are Winchesters. Do you propose
to start Tiaki on this stunt and not tell him what
he’s up against?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Lord, no,’ says Buck. ‘Hope I’m a gentleman&mdash;besides,
that’s what will make him fight. When
he knows Sru has got the arms to attack him, he’ll
do the attacking first, unless he’s a fool.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ says I, and we left it at that.</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>“We slept on deck that night for fear of an attack,
me keeping first watch, but nothing came, and just
at daybreak we put out, towing her till we caught the
land wind and then cracking on all sail for Mauriri.</p>

<p>“We were making ten knots and all that morning
Mauriri bloomed up against us, getting bigger and
bigger till the foam on the big half-moon reef that
lies to northward showed up. There’s a break in
the middle of that reef and good anchorage once
you’re through, and we pushed right in, dropping our
anchor in twenty-fathom water close to the beach.</p>

<p>“Mauriri is a lot more open-faced than Taleka, and
the chief village is close to the beach, not hid up a
valley.</p>

<p>“It was a white beach, but near black with Kanakas
when we dropped the anchor, and there were canoe
houses, but not a canoe put off. The crowd ashore
didn’t look unfriendly, but they seemed standing on
one foot, so to speak, not knowing how to take us
or whether we meant fighting or trade.</p>

<p>“Buck ordered the boat to be lowered and whilst
the Chinks were getting it over I got him by the arm
and took him to the after rail and tried to punch sense
into his head.</p>

<p>“‘Look here,’ I says, ‘what’s the good of revenge?
it’s unchristianlike and it’s not business, anyway.
Forget Sru and trade those crackers for copra, if they’ve
got any here, if they haven’t, put out along for some
other island.’</p>

<p>“‘He killed my Chink’ says Buck. ‘Blow copra,
I want his blood, and I’m going to have it, if it costs
me my last nickel.’</p>

<p>“‘All right, all right,’ I says, ‘come along,’ and
off we put with Taute to do the talking and a box
of stick tobacco to help Tiaki swallow the crackers.</p>

<p>“It was easy to pick him out from the crowd on
the beach, he was over six foot, with the half of an
old willow pattern plate on his chest dangling from
a necklace of sharks’ teeth, he had an underlip like
an apron, one eye gone in some gouging match or
another, and he stood two foot in front of the rest
as if he wasn’t ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>“Taute started the talk whilst Buck opened the
tobacco case, and as I watched Tiaki’s face as the yarn
went on, I thought to myself, God help Sru.</p>

<p>“Then, when the palaver was over, Taute showed
him one of the crackers we’d brought with us and how
it worked, explaining we’d got a cargo of them and how
he could do Sru in.</p>

<p>“There was a dog walking on the beach twenty
yards off, and Tiaki cocking his eye at it took aim and
let fly with the cracker, and there wasn’t any dog left
after the thing had burst, only a hole in the sand.</p>

<p>“You could have heard them shouting at Taleka.
Those chaps ran about clean bughouse, and Buck,
he stood by mighty pleased with himself till all of a
sudden Tiaki quiets them and gives an order and the
crowd broke and made a run for the canoe houses.</p>

<div class='secn'>IV</div>

<p>“‘What’s up now?’ says Buck. He wasn’t long
waiting to know. Four big war canoes pushed out
full of men, and making straight for the Greyhound,
and Taute, who was talking to Tiaki turns and tells
us we were prisoners. Tiaki, for all his underlip, was
no fool, and when Taute had done translating what
he had to say to us his meaning leapt up at us like
luminous paint.</p>

<p>“You see Tiaki had always been used to look on
traders as hard bargainers who’d ask a tooth for a
tenpenny nail, and here we were, us two, blowing in
and offering him a cargo of ammunition for nothing,
so long as he’d go and bomb Sru with it. It seemed
too good to be true, and he suspected a trap. Said
so, right out. He was going to hold us till the business
was over and everything turned out satisfactory.</p>

<p>“I had to swallow twice to keep that news down.
A moment before we’d been free men, and there we
were now like rats in a barrel, but there was no use
kicking, so we sat down on the sand and watched the
canoe men swarming over the <i>Greyhound</i> and breaking
out the cargo. They didn’t touch the Chinks nor loot
the ship, just went for the cracker cases, bringing them
off load after load and dumping them on the sand.</p>

<p>“Tiaki has a case opened and takes out a cracker;
he’d tumbled to the mechanism, and there he stood
with the thing in his hand explaining it to the population,
talking away and flinging out his arms towards
Taleka, evidently gingering them up for the attack
on Sru. Then he gives an order sharp as the crack of
a whip, and all the Marys and children and old chaps
scattered off back to the village, and over a hundred
of the fighting men took their seats on the beach in a
big circle, whilst crackers were handed round to them
and they examined the hang of the things, each man
for himself.</p>

<p>“They were a fine lot, but differently coloured,
some as dark as bar-chocolate and some the colour of
coffee with milk in it, and as they sat there the women
and children and old men came down from the village
bringing bundles of mat baskets with them, and down
they squatted by the edge of the trees going over the
baskets and mending them and putting them in order.</p>

<p>“‘What are they up to?’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Can’t you see?’ says I. ‘They’re going to
carry the crackers in those baskets. They mean
business right enough. Lord! Buck,’ I says, ‘I
wish we were out of this; look at the fix we’re in.
If them chaps are beaten by Sru, we’ll be done in as
sure as paint&mdash;makes me sick, sitting here, and there’s
our boat right before us. S’pose we make a dash
right now, shove her off and get on board&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘Not a bit of use,’ says Buck. ‘They’d let after
us in the canoes before we’d pushed off&mdash;we’ve just
got to stick and see it out. I’m sorry,’ he says; ‘it’s
my fault; you were right, and if I ever get out of this
I’ll steer clear of mixing up in other folks’ quarrels. I
wouldn’t have done it only for the Chink.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it don’t matter,’ I says; ‘we’re in it and there’s
no use in kicking.’</p>

<p>“I called Taute, who was standing watching the
basket work and jabbering with Tiaki, and asked him
for news and what he thought they were going to do
with us in case things went wrong. He went to Tiaki
and had a jabber, and came back to us looking pretty
grey about the gills.</p>

<p>“Tiaki was going to attack Sru right away, starting
that night and reaching Taleka next morning early;
with the current the big war canoes would do the
journey in seven hours. He couldn’t make a night
attack because of the difficulty of getting in, but he
reckoned to reach the bay just at daybreak. Then
came the news that we were to go with them and lead
the attack. Tiaki said as we had sold Sru the guns
to attack Tiaki, it was only fair that we should lead
Tiaki’s men against the guns, besides, he wanted to
make sure we weren’t leading him into a trap; besides,
he had often noticed white men feared nothing
and were splendid fighters. He also said if we failed
him facing the guns of Sru we’d have fish crackers
flung at our backs.</p>

<p>“You see the way that durn cargo served us;
the guns in front of us, the crackers at our back&mdash;we
couldn’t say anything&mdash;couldn’t do anything but
curse Scudder and the day we met him, and sit there
watching the preparations. Women were bringing
down provisions for the canoes, and the baskets were
ready and being distributed. They weren’t so much
baskets as bags such as the natives use for carting
every sort of thing in; each fighting man had one,
and then the crackers were handed round about twenty
to a man. They’d place them between their legs
in the canoes as they paddled; every man had a spear
as well, and as they stood there getting on for sundown,
each man with his basket of bombs and a spear,
I’d have been proud to lead them only I was
so frightened.</p>

<div class='secn'>V</div>

<p>“Now the funniest thing happened.</p>

<p>“All that crowd of fighting men full up of pride
and devilment began shouting and chanting a war
song. That was all right as far as it went, but after
it was over a chocolate-coloured son of a gun began
making a speech, shouting and pointing towards
Taleka as if to say what he wouldn’t do to Sru.</p>

<p>“Then a coffee-coloured devil cut in and seemed to
carry on the argument.</p>

<p>“Taute said the chocolate men and the coffee
grinders were two different races, though joined in
the one tribe, and they were arguing which was the
bravest.</p>

<p>“Other chaps cut in, and then all of a sudden they
began running about, and before you could say
‘knife’ they split, the chocolate men on one side, the
coffee crowd on the other, with Tiaki running about
half bughouse, trying to keep order, and the row growing
bigger all the time till suddenly a coffee man
remembered his bag of bombs and fetches out a cracker,
gives it a twist, and lets fly at the chocolate man
opposite him, sending his head to glory.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see schoolboys snowballing each
other? All over the sands they were, one chap chasing
another, stooping to pick crackers from their bags
and screw them tight and then letting fly, heads and
arms and legs being blown away&mdash;not that we stopped
to watch; we were running for the boat. Next
moment we had her off, and we didn’t wait to pick
up the anchor when we got aboard; we dropped the
chain and shoved, leaving Sru to come over to shovel
up the remains, and pleased to think that the Winchesters
he’d diddled out of us wouldn’t be much use
to him since the crackers had spoiled his target.</p>

<p>“I expect there wasn’t a dozen fighting men on
that island left whole and sound, but that’s neither
here or there. I was just telling you it as a case in
point. There’s something in one tribe that makes
for war against another tribe even if they’ve been
living happily together for years. It shows clearer
in savages than civilised folk, but it’s in both and it’s
got to be reckoned with by anyone who wants to do
away with war for good and all.”</p>

<p>He tapped his pipe out, and we sat watching the
Pacific coming creaming in on the sands and round
the rocks, the Pacific, that storm centre or Lake of
Peace for the whole world, according to the way men
may arrange their tribal differences and call upon
intellect to balance instinct.</p>

<p class='ni'>Sydney is one of the finest towns in the world
and it has the finest harbour, unless you call
San Francisco Bay a harbour, it has the most hospitable
people and a gaiety and push all its own, also,
in the matter of temperature, when it chooses it can
beat any other town except maybe Calcutta.</p>

<p>“A hot shop,” said Brent. He was seated at a
bar adorned with coloured bottles, and a girl with
peroxide of hydrogen tinted hair had just handed
him a lemon squash with a hummock of ice in it.</p>

<p>“You aren’t looking yourself, Captain,” said the
girl.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I aren’t,” replied Brent, “not if I
look as I feel.” He relapsed into gloom and I offered
him a cigarette which he refused.</p>

<p>“I’m going to a funeral,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said I. “Not a near relation, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Well, it might be a relation, by the way I feel,
but I’ve none. When a man gets to my age he leaves
a lot of things astern.” He sighed, finished the last
half of his drink in one mighty gulp, wiped his mouth
and got off his chair.</p>

<p>“Walk down with me a bit of the way,” said he.</p>

<p>We left the bar and entered the blaze of the street.
It was eleven o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>“It ought to be raining,” said the Captain as we
wended our way along King Street towards the
wharves. “Happy is the corpse that the rain rains
on, is the old saying, and she’s a corpse if ever there
was one, but rain or shine, if there’s happiness for
such things as corpses, she’s happy&mdash;she’s done her
duty.”</p>

<p>“What did she die of?” I asked, by way of making
conversation.</p>

<p>“Old age,” replied Brent. He had a black tie on,
but his garb was otherwise unchanged, his mourning
was chiefly expressed by his voice and manner, and
as we drew closer to the whiff of the harbour and the
scent of shipping he took off his panama and mopped
his bald head now and then with a huge red handkerchief.</p>

<p>That handkerchief was always the signal of worry
or perplexity with Brent, and now, right on the
wharves and feeling for his state of mind, I halted to
say good-bye.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you care to see her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No thanks,” I replied. “I ought to meet a man
at twelve and it’s after eleven now&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’ll wait,” replied the Captain. “It’s only a
step from here and she’s <i>worth</i> seeing. Kim on.”</p>

<p>He took me by the arm and led me along, reluctantly
enough, towards some mean-looking buildings, the
relics of old days; under the bowsprit of a full rigged
ship, over hawsers, and then on to a decayed slip of a
wharf beside which an old schooner lay moored.</p>

<p>“That’s her,” said Brent.</p>

<p>On her counter in letters almost vanished stood the
word <i>Greyhound</i>.</p>

<p>“The <i>Greyhound</i>,” said I, “is this the old schooner
you and Slane owned?”</p>

<p>“The same,” said Brent. “She’s to be towed to
the breakers’ yard eight bells&mdash;noon, they gave me
word so that I might have a last look at her.”</p>

<p>So this was the funeral he was to attend. He
mopped his face with the red handkerchief, contemplated
the deck beneath him, heaved a sigh and
then, “Come down,” said he. “I’ve told Jimmy
Scott to leave me something in the cabin.”</p>

<p>He dropped on to the deck and I followed him.
There was no watchman to guard the corpse. I
looked at the standing rigging all gone to ruin and the
sticks that had survived many a gale, the grimy
decks that once had been white, then I dropped
down to the cabin after Brent.</p>

<p>The ports were open and water shimmers from the
harbour water danced on the maple panelling, the
upholstery had been eaten by rats or roaches and a
faint smell filled the place like the ghost of the odour
of corruption, but there was a bottle of whisky on
the table, a couple of glasses and a syphon.</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t met you, I’d ’a brought someone
else,” said Brent, taking his seat before the funeral
refreshments, “but there’s not many I’d have sooner
had than you to give her a send off. You remember
I told you, Buck had her from Pat O’Brien who didn’t
know her qualities, no one did in those days; why,
a chap by name of Gadgett come aboard first day we
had her and said she ought to be condemned, said
she wasn’t seaworthy and that’s many years ago.”
He took the cork from the bottle and poured
“Many years ago and now I’m having my last
drink and smoke here where Buck and me have often
sat, and him in the cemetery. Well, here’s to you,
Buck&mdash;and here’s to her.” We drank and lit up.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s had her day,” said I, trying to say
something cheerful. “It’s like a wife that has done
her duty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Captain snorted.</p>

<p>“Wives,” said he, “a ship’s all the wife I’ve ever
had and I don’t want no other, it’s all the wife a
sailor-man wants and if she’s decently found and run,
she never lets him down. I told that to Buck once.
I told him the <i>Greyhound</i> was his lawful wife and he’d
come a mucker if he took another. He wouldn’t
believe me, but he found it out. You’ve never seen
him. He died only four years ago and he hadn’t
lost a tooth, he hadn’t got a grey hair on his head,
six foot he stood and he’d only to look at a girl and
she’d follow him, but he wasn’t given that way after
his marriage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he got married, did he?” said I. “I always
fancied from what you told me of him that he was a
single man.&mdash;Did she die?”</p>

<p>“I expect she’s dead by this,” said the Captain.
“No knowing, but if she ain’t she ought to be. We
fell in with her, me and Slane, the year after that dust
up with Sru I told you of. We’d lost money on that
job, but we’d pulled up over a deal in silver that had
come our way through Pat O’Brien and Buck had
thirty thousand dollars in the Bank of California,
and I’d got near ten in my pocket. I didn’t trust
banks. For all that money we lived quiet, not being
given to drink, and we were fitting the <i>Greyhound</i>
out for a new job, when one night at a sociable we
met in with Mrs. Slade. That was the name she
gave herself, a fine, fresh-faced young woman, not
thirty, with eyes like Cape mulberries, they had that
red look in the black of them, and a laundry of her
own they said was bringing in five hundred a week
profit. She harpooned Buck. Clean through the
gizzard. You’ve seen a chicken running about with
a woman after it till she catches it and wrings its neck,
that was Buck. He was no more good after she’d got
the irons into him.</p>

<p>“One night I had it out with him. I said: ‘The
Lord Almighty has given you a ship to tend and take
care of, she’s been true to you and brought you in
the dollars, and look at the way you’re usin’ her, why,
we ought to have had her out of dock by this and the
cargo half on board her, she over there at Oakland
and you foolandering after a widow woman.’</p>

<p>“‘She’s a girl,’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Well, woman or girl don’t matter,’ I says, ‘you
ain’t the age for marrying, nor the sort of chap to
make good at the game.’ We went at it hammer and
tongs, me trying to pump sense into him like a chap
trying to pump up a burst bicycle tyre, but at last,
somehow or another, I began to get the better of the
business and bring him to reason and by two in the
morning I’d brought him to own he was a damn fool
and marriage a mug’s game. I went to bed happy,
and next day he turned up at noon with a flower in his
coat and looking as if he’d gone queer in his head.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” I says.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve just been married,’ says he.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>“That’s the sort of chap a woman had made of him.
I’ve heard it said a woman is the making of a chap,
it’s true, if she’s a good woman she’ll make a man of
a fool, and if she’s bad she’ll make a fool of any man,
seems to me. Jinny Slade was bad. I’ve got instincts
about things and maybe that’s what made
me so down on the business from the first&mdash;them
mulberry eyes of hers rose my bristles, somehow or
another, but now she’d fixed him there was no use
talking.</p>

<p>“They took up housekeeping in Francis Street
over the laundry, and not wishing to mix up in their
hymeneal bliss, I didn’t see much of Buck for a
month or more. The <i>Greyhound</i> was out of dock
and I brought her over to her moorings at Tiburon,
and I’d sit here just as I’m sitting now, time and
again, thinking of old times and the fool Buck was
making of himself, for we’d lost the cargo a trader
had promised us and our business was going to smash.</p>

<p>“One day I was leaning on the rail fishing with a
hand line for want of something better to do when a
guy comes along in a boat&mdash;Newall was his name&mdash;he’d
known us for a couple of years, casual, and he’d
just put off from an Oregon boat that lay anchored a
bit out.</p>

<p>“‘How’s Buck?’ says he, resting on his oars.</p>

<p>“‘Buck’s married,’ I says. ‘Married this month
and more.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I wish him luck,’ says Newall, ‘and who’s
the lady?’”</p>

<p>I tells him.</p>

<p>“‘Holy Mike,’ he says. ‘Jinny Slade&mdash;what made
him do it?’</p>

<p>“I told him I didn’t know unless it was the devil,
and then I asked what he knew about the party.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says Newall, ‘I’m a cautious man and
I’m not going to lay myself open to no law court
actions for deffination of character. I’m not going to
say nothing about the woman except that she oughta
been flung into the bay two years ago with a sinker
tied to her middle, and then you wouldn’t have saved
her first husband which she poisoned as sure as my
name’s Dan Newall, no, nor the men she ruined in
that gambling joint she run in Caird Street with a
loaded r’lette wheel that’d stay put wherever you
wanted by the pressin’ of a button under the table,
run by a Chink it was with her money.</p>

<p>“‘In with the crimps she was, and if I had a dollar
for every sailor-man she’s helped to shanghai I’d buy
a fishin’ boat and make my fortune out of catchin’
the crabs that are feedin’ on the corpses of the men
that’s drowned themselves because of her.</p>

<p>“‘Laundry,’ he says, ‘a laundry s’big as from here
to Porte Costa, with every Chink in California workin’
overtime for a month wouldn’t wash the edges of her
repitation&mdash;and Buck’s married her; strewth, but he’s
got himself up to the eyes. What sort of blinkers
were you wearin’ to let him do it?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ I says, ‘alligator hide I should
think was the sort he was wearing, anyhow. Question
is what am I to do now?’</p>

<p>“‘Take a gun and shoot him,’ says Newall, ‘if you
want to be kind to him.&mdash;Has she got any money out
of him?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘Been married to him a month,’ he goes on.
‘She’ll have every jitney by this&mdash;well, if you’re set
on trying to do somethin’ for him, get the last of his
money from him if he’s got any and hide it in a hole
for him before she kicks him out plucked naked.’”</p>

<p>Off he rowed, and pulling up my line I left the
<i>Greyhound</i> to the Kanaka watchman and took the
ferry over to ’Frisco.</p>

<p>The laundry was banging away, the Chinks all
hard at work, Mrs. Slade wasn’t home, over at St.
Jo for the day, so the forewoman said, but Buck was
in and upstairs, and up I went.</p>

<p>They’d got a fine sitting-room on the first floor
with plush-covered chairs and brand new old-fashioned
looking furniture and a bowl of goldfish in the
window and pictures in big gold frames on the
walls.</p>

<p>Buck was sitting in an easy chair reading a paper
and smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” he says, “here’s a coincidence, for I
was just coming over to Tiburon to see you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, were you?” says I. “Wits jump sometimes
and here I am on the same job. How’s the world
using you, Buck?”</p>

<p>I tried to be as light-hearted as I could, but it was
hard work. Buck had gone off in looks, and it was
plain to see things weren’t going easy with him,
you can always tell when a chap has something on
his mind, and whilst he was getting out drinks I
sat putting my thoughts together and only waiting
to begin. I’d fixed to do a big grab, and get ten
thousand dollars out of him as a loan to hide away
for him against the time he got the kick out, plucked
naked, as Newall had said.</p>

<p>He pours the whisky.</p>

<p>“Buck,” I says, taking the glass. “I’ve come to
ask a favour of you. I want a loan.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asks Buck.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I’ve ten thousand dollars of my
own, as you know, and I’ve been offered a big opportunity
of making a hundred thousand. Safe as
houses. I want ten thousand to put with mine, I
wouldn’t ask you to risk yours if I wasn’t risking
mine.”</p>

<p>“What’s the spec.?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell you that,” I said&mdash;“I’m under promise,
but you know me and I give you my word of honour
your money is as safe as if it was in your pocket&mdash;safer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d do it if I could,” he says, “you know
me and that I’m not lying when I speak, but I can’t,
haven’t got it.”</p>

<p>“But, Buck,” I says, “why, only a month ago you
had thirty thousand dollars in the bank.”</p>

<p>Buck nods and goes on. “I haven’t got it to put
my hand on,” he says. “My wife is keeping it for
me. She says what with those New York banks
going bust last spring and one thing and another,
banks aren’t safe and she wants to invest it, she’s
over at St. Jo to-day looking at some property.”</p>

<p>“Where’s she got the money?” I asks.</p>

<p>“In that safe,” says he.</p>

<p>Sure enough there was a big iron safe in the corner
of the room half hid by a screen.</p>

<p>Seeing how the land lay, I said no more, and he
changed the subject, going back to what he was
saying when I first came in, how that he had been
coming to see me that afternoon about a matter of
business.</p>

<p>He wouldn’t say what the business was, but he
wanted my help and he wanted it that night. He
also wanted the boat of the <i>Greyhound</i> brought over
to Long Wharf.</p>

<p>“Just bring her over yourself,” said he. “No,
we don’t want help, just you and me will manage
it, and bring the mast and sail and some grub, never
mind what I want her for, I’ll tell you later, it’s a
paying business, as you’ll find.”</p>

<p>With that I took my leave of him and hiked off
back to Tiburon, for the day was getting on and I
had none too much time to get things together.</p>

<p>I was bothered and that’s the truth; Buck had
gone off, wasn’t the same chap, and by his manner
when he asked me to meet him with the boat, I knew
it wasn’t pleasure sailing he was after. I near
scratched the top off my head thinking what he could
be wanting with that boat, but it was beyond me
and I gave it up. Taute was the name of the Kanaka,
same chap we had with us when we did that gun-running
job down at Taleka, and when I got back
to the <i>Greyhound</i> I set Taute to work, getting some
grub together and a new spar for a mast as the old
one was sprung. Then, getting along for evening, I
rowed over to Long Wharf. Long Wharf was pretty
busy just then, what with wheat ships cleaning up
before towing to Berkley for cargo and Oregon timber
ships and such. There was a schooner lying there
belonging to a chap I knew, so I just tied up to her
channel-plates and crossed over on to the wharf
where I sits on a bollard kicking my heels and waiting
for Buck.</p>

<p>Along he comes just on dark, and without a word
he follows me across the deck of the schooner into the
boat.</p>

<p>Tell you I felt queer. We’d sailed pretty close to
the wind together me and him, gun-running and what
not, but this job seemed different, sort of back-door
business with the harbour police or the Fish Patrol
waiting to lay for us if we hitched up on it anywhere.
I’d been used to blue water doings and big things
and it got my goat to feel we were after something
small and shady. It wasn’t small by any means,
but, anyhow, that’s how I felt. But I said nothing,
taking the oars and Buck taking his place in the
stern sheets. Then we pushed off, Buck steering and
making as if he was layin’ a course for Oakland. A
few cable lengths out we took the wind and put up
the mast, and, Buck taking the sheet, off we set still
laying as if we were bound for Oakland. I’d sooner
be out anywhere than in the lower bay after dark,
what between them dam screeching ferry boats and the
motor launches and such. Every monkey in ’Frisco
with brass enough seems to have some sort or another
of a launch or yacht and to spend his natural trying
to run folks down. We were near cut into twice,
seeing we had no light, but after a while, getting off
the main track and Buck shifting his helm, we got
along better.</p>

<p>He was steering now laying straight for Angel
Island. We passed Racoon Straits and kept on,
the breeze freshening hard and the boat laying over
to it. The sky was clear and a big moon was coming
over the hills. Wonderful fine the bay is a night
like that, with all the lights round showing yellow
against the moon and ’Frisco showing up against
Oakland.</p>

<p>However, we weren’t out to admire the view and we
held on, at least Buck did, till we were near level, as
far as I could make out, with Reeds and aiming for
Red Rock, the wind holding well. We passed a Stockton
boat and an old brig coming down from Benicia
or somewhere up there. Then away ahead and
coming along square as a haystack I sighted a Chinese
junk. Buck let go the sheet and, lighting a lantern
he’d brought with us, ran it up.</p>

<p>“What are you doing that for?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Show you in a minute,” says Buck. “Give
us the boat-hook.”</p>

<p>I handed it along and he told me to have the oars
handy and then we sat whilst the junk came along
at a six-knot clip, boosting the water and the great
eyes in the bow of her showing in the moonlight as
if they were staring at us, but not a soul to be seen or
a light on deck.</p>

<p>She snored along to starboard of us not more than
ten yards away, black as thunder against the moon,
and she was showing us her stern when something
went splash over her side, followed by something else
as if two chaps had gone a dive, one after the other.</p>

<p>On top of that and almost at once a Holmes light
was thrown over and went floating along, blazing
and smoking and showing a man’s head squatting
beside it.</p>

<p>“Man overboard,” I says.</p>

<p>“Row,” says Buck.</p>

<p>I turned my head as I rowed and saw the junk
going along as if nothing had happened, and then
I saw the thing in the water wasn’t a man’s head but
a buoy. We closed with the buoy and Buck grabs
it with the boat-hook and brings it on board. It
had a rope tied to it and he hauls it in, hand over
hand, till up came a bundle done round with sacking.
He hooks it over the gunnel and into the boat.</p>

<p>“That’s done,” said he.</p>

<p>“It is,” said I.</p>

<p>I didn’t say a word more. We got the sail on her
and put her on the starboard tack, heading straight
for Angel Island.</p>

<p>Then we shoved through Racoon Straits. It was
getting along for morning now and I felt stiff and
beat, with no heart in me or tongue to tell Buck
what I was thinking of him for dragging me into a
business like this, only praying we might get out of
it without being overhauled.</p>

<p>We had Tiburon lights to starboard now and a bit
to port the riding light of the old <i>Greyhound</i>, when,
all of a sudden, we see a light running along towards
us and heard the noise of a propeller like a sewing
machine in a hurry.</p>

<p>“Police boat,” says Buck.</p>

<p>My heart rose up and got jammed in my throat,
and I hadn’t more than swallowed it down when
they were alongside of us, and there was Buck sitting
in the stern sheets with the bundle under his legs,
and a chap in the police boat playing a lantern on him.</p>

<p>Then the chap laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only you, Buck,” says he. “What are
you out for this time of night?”</p>

<p>“Smuggling opium,” says Buck.</p>

<p>The chap laughed. He was Dennis, well known
to us both, and he shut his lantern and gave us the
news that he was after some Chink smugglers who
had their quarters at Valego and, fearing their shop
was to be raided, were due to run some stuff into
Tiburon that night according to his information.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve just come down from San Quenton,”
says Buck, “and I didn’t sight anything, only a big
junk that passed us, making as if she was going to
Oakland&mdash;Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>Off they went and five minutes after we were tying
up to the <i>Greyhound</i>.</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>We got the stuff on board, right down here where
we are sitting now, and he undoes the sacking and
there stood six cans of Canton opium, worth Lord
knows what a can.</p>

<p>I got the whisky out and had a big drink before I
could get my hind legs under me to go for him.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “this is a nice night’s work.
S’pose Dennis hadn’t been in that police boat?
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Don’t you see
you’ve been trading on your good name, for if Dennis
hadn’t believed in you, we’d both be in quad now
with the shackles on us&mdash;And look what you’ve done
to the <i>Greyhound</i>.”</p>

<p>“What have I done to her?” he fires.</p>

<p>“Done to her,” I says. “Why, you’ve made
her disrespectable, that’s what you’ve done to her.”</p>

<p>“Lord, is this the first shady job she’s been in?”
says he. “Why, look at those guns we run&mdash;what’s
the difference?”</p>

<p>“Guns aren’t dope,” I says, “and whites aren’t
Chinks. You’ve been hand in fist with Chinks over
this, but there’s no use talking. It’s done.”</p>

<p>I knew it was the wife at the back of him. That
was the cause of it all, so I didn’t rub it in any more.
I remembered Newall’s words about her and the
men she’d done in, and I saw as plain as paint
that laundry of hers was only a blind for the Lord
knows what. I just had another drink, and then
I asked him what he was going to do with the stuff
now he had it on board. He said he was going to
stick it in the lazarette for a few days till things
were quiet and then he’d get it ashore, can by can,
and he’d do it all himself and not ask me to help him.</p>

<p>Then we got the stuff into the lazarette and had
a snooze, and somewhere about noon next day he
goes ashore, leaving me on board.</p>

<p>I couldn’t eat nor sit still, couldn’t do anything
but smoke and walk the deck. I reckon when a
man’s in trouble there’s nothing better than tobacco,
it gives him better advice than all the friends in the
world.</p>

<p>There I was with that stuff in the lazarette and
who knew what moment some gink or another would
give the show away and the police would be aboard.
I wasn’t thinking of myself so much as Buck, and after
him I was thinking of his wife and wishing I had her
aboard to drown her.</p>

<p>But worry as much as I liked, I couldn’t see a way
out; the only way was to break him off from her
and get him away, for this was only the beginning of
things and I knew it would end in perdition for him.
She’d managed to get some power over him with
those mulberry eyes of hers, and how to loose it was
beyond me.</p>

<p>I slept aboard that night and somewhere getting
along for morning, I sat up in my bunk with a plan
full made in my head. I must have been thinking
it out in my sleep, or maybe it was the Almighty
put it into my mind, but it was a peach. Question
was, could I work it?</p>

<p>First thing I did was to make a dive for the lazarette
and get those opium tins out; getting them on deck
I dumped them one by one, and every splash I said
to myself: “There goes a bit of that damn woman.”
It was just before sun up and there was nobody to
see.</p>

<p>“Now,” I says to myself, “the old <i>Greyhound’s</i> a
clean ship again and Buck will be a clean man before
dark if I have to break the laundry up and her on
top of it.”</p>

<p>Getting on for breakfast time I sent Taute ashore
for some things and did the cooking myself, then,
towards noon, I rowed ashore and took the ferry for
’Frisco.</p>

<p>I was as full of nerves as a barber’s cat. It wasn’t
what I was going to do that rattled me, but the knowing
that if I didn’t pull it off, Buck would be ruined for
life.</p>

<p>When I got to the laundry I couldn’t go in. I
walked up and down the street saying to myself:
“Bill, you’ve gotta do it; no use hanging in irons,
you’ve got old Buck to think of. Make yourself think
what you’re going to say is true, now or never, in you
go, give her the harpoon.”</p>

<p>In I goes. The head woman said they were upstairs,
and up I went.</p>

<p>They’d finished their dinner and Buck was smoking
a cigar, the woman was still at the table, peeling
an apple.</p>

<p>“Buck,” I says, “it’s up, the police are after
you. I’ve run all the way to tell you. Dennis has
given me word and you’ve still time to save yourself
if you’re quick.”</p>

<p>The woman gives a squeal and flings the apple
on the table.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” says Buck.</p>

<p>Then I turns on his wife and gives her the length
of my tongue for leading him into the business, and
she ups and gives me the lie, saying she had nothing
to do with it, winking at him to back her, which
the fool did, but so half-hearted you could see he
wasn’t telling the truth.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “it doesn’t matter, the question
is now to get him out of ’Frisco. Dennis has given
me three hours to get the <i>Greyhound</i> out with him
on board her and save him from the penitentiary.
Has he any money?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got his money,” says she. “Buck, stir
yourself,” she says. “I’ll pack a bag for you and
here’s the notes you give me to keep.” She goes
to the safe and unlocks it and takes out a bundle
done up in brown paper, and he stuffs it in his pocket,
and she packs his bag and off I drags him.</p>

<p>Out in the street I told him to wait a minute, and
ran back, and there she was in the room locking the
safe.</p>

<p>“I ought to have told you,” said I, “they’re after
you too; clear out of ’Frisco, git by the next train or
they’ll have you.”</p>

<p>“Who’s give me away?” she cries.</p>

<p>“The Chinks,” says I; and at that she let a yelp
out of her, and falls on the sofa in a dead faint.
I opened the safe and there I sees a parcel the
identical of the one she’d given Buck, and I put it in
my pocket after a squint at the contents. Then
I put her feet up, and lit out to where Buck was waiting
for me in the street, and catching him by the arm I
dragged him along down to the wharves where Taute
was waiting with the boat. We got over to the
<i>Greyhound</i>, and then the three of us set to work
to get that schooner out of the bay, a six men’s job,
but we done it.</p>

<p>All the time we were handling her and getting across
the bar I was thinking hard enough to split my head
open. Outside I came to a conclusion.</p>

<p>“Buck,” I said, “you’re free of her now.”</p>

<p>“Who?” says he.</p>

<p>“Your wife,” says I.</p>

<p>Then I told him all I’d done. I thought he’d have
knifed me. He was for putting back right away till
I played my last card. I was only working on suspicion
but I was right.</p>

<p>“Put your hand in your pocket,” I said, “and pull
out that bundle of notes your wife gave you. If the
tally is right, I’ll go straight back with you and
apologise to her.”</p>

<p>He pulls out the parcel and opens it. It was full
of bits of newspaper and old washing bills. Then I
pulls out the other parcel I’d nicked and there were
his notes.</p>

<p>Brent relit his pipe.</p>

<p>“He never saw her again,” said Brent. “When we
put back to ’Frisco, the laundry was shut and she
gone. He didn’t want to see her either. The old
<i>Greyhound</i> was enough for him after his experience
of women&mdash;and now she’s going too.”</p>

<p>We sat for a while in silence and tobacco smoke,
then Brent looked up. The coughing and churning
of a tug came through the open skylight and the hot
hazy atmosphere of the cabin.</p>

<p>“That’s them,” said Brent.</p>

<p>We came on deck. Then we climbed on to the wharf
whilst Scott’s men went aboard, true undertakers’
assistants, callous, jovial, red-faced, gin-breathing.
We watched the tow rope passed and the mooring
ropes cast off, the tow rope tighten and the bowsprit
of the <i>Greyhound</i> turning for the last time from land.
We watched the smashed-up water of the harbour
streaming like a millrace under the bat-bat-bat of
the tug paddles and the stern of the Greyhound with
the faded old lettering turned towards a wharf for
the last time.</p>

<p>As the vision faded, Brent heaved a deep sigh,
thinking maybe of his partner and old times.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, turning away, “that’s the end of
her. What gets me is that the other one may be alive
and kicking her heels and enjoying herself&mdash;no knowing,
it’s those sort that live longest, seems to me.”</p>

<p class='ni'>If you want to study psychology go to the wilds.
The minds of civilised men and women are so
covered with embroidery that the true texture is almost
hidden; their faces have been used so long for masks
that form and expression cannot be relied on.
Amongst savages you come sometimes upon the
strangest facts bearing upon the structure of mind,
facts that lose half their significance in the atmosphere
of London, yet which, all the same, are not unconnected
with our processes of reasoning and conduct.</p>

<p>I was sitting with Brent in the house of Ibanez,
the agent of the Southern Islands Soap Syndicate, an
institution that turns cocoanut trees and native labour
into soap, mats, margarine, dollars and dividends,
beats up the blue Pacific with the propellers of filthy
steamboats and has its offices in San Francisco, London
and New York. We were sitting, to speak more
strictly, in the verandah, the southern night lay
before us and a million stars were lighting the sea.</p>

<p>Tahori, a native boy, and one of Ibanez’s servants,
had just brought along a big tray with cigars and drinks
and placed it on a table by us. I noticed that he wore
white cotton gloves. Brent had also noticed the fact.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with that chap’s hands?” asked
Brent.</p>

<p>“Tahori’s?” replied our host. “Nothing&mdash;only
he must not touch glass.”</p>

<p>“Tabu?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He only helps occasionally in household
work when Mauri is away. I got over the difficulty
of his waiting upon me by giving him gloves in case
he accidentally touched a tumbler or bottle; even
with the gloves on he will not handle anything in
the way of glass knowingly; the cook puts the things
on that tray, and when he takes it back to the kitchen
she will clear it.”</p>

<p>“I thought all that was dying out,” said Brent.</p>

<p>“So it is, but it still hangs about. Tahori is a
South Island boy. I don’t know why the tabu about
glass came about, makes it awkward for him as a
servant.”</p>

<p>“No one knows,” said Brent. “I’ve seen chaps
that were under tabu preventing them from eating
oysters and others that daren’t touch the skin of a
shark or the wood of such and such a tree, no one
knows why.”</p>

<p>“What do they suppose would happen to them if
they broke the tabu?” I asked.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t,” said Brent.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t?”</p>

<p>“No, they couldn’t. I’m talking of the real old
Islanders whose minds haven’t been loosened up by
missionaries and such, though I’m not so sure it
wouldn’t hold good for the present-day ones too, and
I’m saying that a chap like that couldn’t break his tabu
not if he wanted to, not if his life depended on it;
beliefs are pretty strong things, but this is something
stronger even than a belief; maybe it’s the mixture
of a custom and a belief, and that makes it have such
a hold on the mind, but there it is&mdash;I’ve seen it.”</p>

<p>“Seen a man unable to break his tabu?”</p>

<p>“Seen the effects, anyhow, same as you might see
the wreck of a ship lying on a beach. I doubt if
you’d see the same thing these days, though there’s no
telling; anyhow, it was away back in the early nineties
and I’d just come up from the Tongas to Tahiti,
getting a lift in the <i>Mason Gower</i>, she was an old
trading schooner the missionaries had collared and
turned into a Bible ship, and I lent my hand with the
cooking to pay for my passage.</p>

<p>“I’d had a quarrel with Slane and parted from
him, taking my share of the money we had in common,
and I hadn’t seen him for six months and more. I
hadn’t prospered either, losing nearly every buck in
a blackbirding venture I ought never to have gone in
for.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t more than ten dollars in my belt when I
landed at Papeete, but I’d saved my dunnage and had
some decent clothes and the luck to fall in with Billy
Heffernan at the club. Billy was one of the Sydney
boys; he wasn’t more than twenty-five, but he’d
seen more of the world than most and lost two fortunes
which he’d made with his own hands. That was the
sort Billy was, and when I struck him at Papeete he
was recovering from his last bust-up and had got
the money together for another venture.</p>

<p>“His first fortune had been made over Sing Yang
opium, which isn’t opium no more than Sam Shu is
honest drink; then he’d done a deal in shell and pulled
it off and lost the money in copra, and now he was after
precious coral.</p>

<p>“When I met him in the bar I said: ‘Hello, Heff&mdash;what
are you after down here,’ and he says, ‘Coral.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, you’ll find lots of it,’ says I, thinking he
was joking, and then I found it was precious coral
he was talking of. You see there’s about a hundred
different sorts of coral. Coral’s made by worms.
If you go on any reef and knock a chunk off between
tide marks you’ll find your chunk has got worms
hanging out of it. I’ve done it often in different
parts, and I’ve been surprised to find the difference in
those worms. Some are a foot long and as thin as a
hair, and some are an inch thick and as long as your
finger; some are like snails and some are like lobsters
and prawns in shape; some are yellow and some blue.
Above tide marks you don’t find anything, just solid
rock. Well, there’s just as many different sorts of
coral as there is worms, and there’s only one sort of
precious coral and it’s a pale pink, the colour of a rose
leaf, and that’s what Heffernan was after. He’d heard
of an island in the Paumotus which isn’t very far from
Tahiti, and by all accounts it was a good fishing ground
for pink coral, and more than that, it was said the
Queen of the place&mdash;for it was run by a woman&mdash;had a
lot of the stuff for sale&mdash;Tawela was her name.</p>

<p>“Ships keep clear of the Paumotus on account of
the currents that run every which way and the winds
that aren’t dependable. Heff had his information
from a whaling captain who’d struck the place the year
before and had talk with the Kanakas. He was on
the beach broken down with drink, and gave the
location for twenty dollars. He said he didn’t think
they were a dependable lot, but they had the stuff,
and if Heffernan didn’t mind taking risks he might
make a fortune. Heff asked the old chap why he
hadn’t gone in for the business himself, and he answered
that he would have done so only he had no trade
goods; nothing but whale oil, and the Kanakas
didn’t want that, they wanted knives and tobacco
and any sort of old guns and print calico and so on.
Heft didn’t know where to get any such things as these,
and hadn’t the money if he had known, nor a ship
to lade them into, but next day, by good luck, came
blowing in the <i>Mary Waters</i>, owned and captained
by Matt Sellers, a Boston chap who’d come round
to the Pacific in a whaler out of Martha’s Vineyard,
skipped at the Society Islands not liking the society on
board, and risen from roustabout to recruiter and
recruiter to captain and owner. He’d brought a
mixed cargo from ’Frisco on spec to the Marquesas,
couldn’t find a market and had come on to Papeete,
couldn’t find a market and came into the club for
a drink, fell into the arms, as you may say, of Heffernan,
and that did him. He hadn’t been talking half
an hour with Heff when he sees clearly that the hand
of the Almighty was in the business, and that a sure
fortune was waiting for him if he’d only take the
trouble to pick it up. His trade goods were just the
things wanted to buy the stuff, and he only had to
put out for the Paumotus to get it. That was the
way Heff mesmerised him. Then they had a talk
as to the profits, and Sellers agreed to give Heff twenty-five
per cent. commission on the deal.</p>

<p>“I blew into the business, as I was saying, by
meeting Heffernan a few days later&mdash;day before the
<i>Mary Waters</i> was due to sail&mdash;and, seeing no chance
of doing much in Papeete, I joined in with them at
second officer’s pay, but without any duty, only to
lend a hand if there should be a dust-up.</p>

<p>“Next day we started, steering a course almost
due east. We weren’t long in finding out we’d struck
the Paumotus, tide rips everywhere and reefs, then
you’d see cocoanut trees growing out of the sea ahead
and presently you’d be skimming by a beach of coral
not ten feet above the sea level with cocoanut trees
blowing in the wind and Kanaka children shouting at
you. Very low free board those atoll islands have, and
I’ve heard of ships being blown right over the beaches
into the lagoons. We passed a big island like that,
and then, two days after, we raised Utiali; that was
the name of the island the whaler captain had given to
Heffernan with the latitude and longitude. It wasn’t
down in the South Pacific Directory. They’ve got
it there now, but in those days there was no mention
of Utiali, though the whaler captains knew it well
enough, but a whaler captain would never bother to
report an island; if he’d struck the New Jerusalem
he wouldn’t have done more than log it as a place
where you could take on milk and honey. Whales
was all they cared for, and blubber.</p>

<p>“We came along up and found the place answering
to all descriptions, lagoon about a mile wide, break
to the east, good show of cocoanut trees and deep
soundings all to north-east and south, with another
island not bigger than the palm of your hand to west
running out from a line of reef that joined with the
beach of Utiali.</p>

<p>“If the place had been painted blue with the name
in red on it, it couldn’t have been plainer.</p>

<p>“We came along to the eastward till we saw the
opening, and got through without any bother just on
the slack.</p>

<p>“It was a pretty place to look at. I’ve never
seen a stretch of water that pleased me more than that
lagoon; maybe it was the depth or something to do
with the water itself, but it was more forget-me-not
colour than sea blue, and where it was green in the
shallows or the ship shadow, that green was brighter
and different from any green I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s why precious coral grew there, since
the water colours were so clear and bright, the coral
colours following suit would hit on new ideas, so to
speak, but however that may have been, there was no
denying the fact that Utiali was a garden, and the
native houses on shore seemed the gardeners’ cottages&mdash;had
that sort of innocent look.</p>

<p>“We dropped the hook close in shore on to a
flower bed where you could see the sea anemones and
the walking shells as clear as if there wasn’t more than
two foot of water over them, and before the schooner
had settled to the first drag of the ebb that was
beginning to set, canoes began to come off with
Kanakas in them.</p>

<p>“They came along paddling under the counter,
waving their paddles to us, and then, having gone
round us, like as if they were making a tour of inspection,
they tied up and came on board, led by a big
Kanaka Mary&mdash;a beauty to look at, with lovely eyes&mdash;Lord,
I remember those eyes&mdash;who gave herself a
bang on the chest with her fist and said ‘Tawela.’
That was how she presented her visiting card.</p>

<p>“We had a Kanaka with us who could talk most
of the island tongues, and we put him on to Tawela
to extract information from her and it came up in
chunks.</p>

<p>“Tawela, by her own accounts, was anxious to
trade anything from cocoanuts to her back teeth.
She wanted guns and rum, which we hadn’t got, but
she said she’d try to make out with tobacco and beads.
She said she had plenty of pink coral, and would we
come on shore and look at it, also would we come to
dinner and she would give us the time of our lives.</p>

<p>“Then she went off ashore, us promising to follow
on in an hour or so.</p>

<p>“I was talking to Sellers after she’d left, when
Sellers says to me: ‘Look over there, what’s that?’
I looks where he was pointing and I sees something
black sticking from the water away out in the lagoon.
The tide was ebbing, as I’ve told you, and the thing,
whatever it was, had been uncovered by the ebb;
it didn’t look like the top of a rock, it didn’t look
like anything you could put a name to unless maybe
the top of an old stake sticking from the water.
‘Go over and have a look,’ says Sellers, ‘and find what
it is.’ I took the boat which had been lowered ready
to take us ashore, and me and Heffernan pulls out.</p>

<p>“‘It’s the mast of a ship,’ says Heff, who was
steering, and no sooner had he given it its name than
I saw plain enough it couldn’t be anything else.</p>

<p>“It was, and as we brought the boat along careful,
the ship bloomed up at us, the fish playing round
the standing rigging and a big green turtle sinking
from sight of us into her shadow.</p>

<p>“She lay as trigg as if she was on the stocks, with
scarcely a list and her bow pointing to the break
in the reef. Her anchor was in the coral, and you
could see the slack of the chain running to her bow.
She’d been a brig. The top masts had been hacked
off for some reason or another, and pieces of canvas,
yards long some of them, showed waving from her
foreyard, and it was plain to be seen she’d been sunk
with the foresail on her and the canvas had got slashed
by fish and the wear of the tides bellying it this way
and that till there was nothing left but just them
rags.</p>

<p>“I’d never seen a ship murdered before and said so.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ says Heffernan, ‘it’s plain enough, she’s
been sunk at her moorings; look at the way she’s
lying, and look at that anchor chain. Well, I never
did think to see a sunk ship at anchor, but I’ve seen
it now.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s the chaps ashore that have done this,’
said I.</p>

<p>“‘Sure,’ said Heffernan. ‘Done in the ship and
done in the crew. We’ve got to go careful.’</p>

<p>“We put back to the <i>Mary Waters</i> and reported
to Sellers.</p>

<p>“‘Skunks!’ said Sellers. ‘Tawela’s Queen Bee of
a proper hive. Well, we must be careful, that’s all.
Keep our guns handy and give word to the Kanakas
to be on the look-out.’</p>

<p>“The <i>Mary Waters</i> had a Kanaka crew as I’ve said,
and having given the bo’sun the tip to be on the look-out
for squalls, we got rowed ashore, sending the
boat back to the schooner.</p>

<p>“Tawela’s house was the first of the line of houses
that ran east and west along the beach; it was the
biggest, too, and there was only her and her son at
the dinner; the rest of the tribe had gone off in the
canoes right across the lagoon to the opposite shore
to gather shell-fish on the outer beach. Our Kanaka
boy that acted as interpreter got this news from Tawela,
and it lightened our minds a lot, for if any killing
had been meant the tribe wouldn’t have gone off like
that.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a bad dinner, take it all round. Baked
pig and oysters, and sweet potatoes and so on, with a
palm salad that Tawela never invented herself, that
I’ll lay a dollar, and said so.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, she’s probably made the cook of that brig
show her how to do things white man style before she
murdered him,’ says Sellers.</p>

<p>“‘Damn her,’ says Heffernan, and there those two
sat talking away, she listening but not understanding;
it was better than a pantomime.</p>

<p>“Then the son gets up and brings in some palm
toddy, best I ever struck, and Sellers opens a box of
cigars he’d brought with him, and we all lit up, Tawela
included.</p>

<p>“I remember, as plain as if it was only ten minutes
ago, sitting there looking at the sunlight coming in
through the door behind Sellers and striking through
the blue smoke of the cigars, and then the next thing
I remember is waking up with my hands tied and my
feet roped together, lying on my back in a shack with
the morning light coming through the cracks in the
wall, Heffernan and Sellers beside me.</p>

<p>“It was plain enough what had happened; we’d
been doped. I heard Sellers give a groan and called
out to him, then Heffernan woke, and there we lay
admiring ourselves for the fools we’d been in falling
into that mug trap. We’d each landed with a revolver
strapped to his belt, but the revolvers were gone.</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>“We hadn’t been lying there cursing ourselves more
than half an hour when, the sun having got over
the reef, a chap comes in, catches Sellers by the
heels and drags him out just as if he’d been a dead
carcase.</p>

<p>“‘Good-bye, boys,’ cries Sellers, as he’s dragged
along the ground, and good-bye it was, for a few
minutes after we heard him scream.</p>

<p>“He went on screaming for fifteen minutes, maybe
more, and I was fifteen years older when he let off
and the silence came up again with nothing but the
sound of the reef and the jabbering of those cursed
Kanakas.</p>

<p>“‘If I had a knife I’d stick it into myself,’ says
Heffernan. ‘Lord! what have they been doing to
him?’</p>

<p>“I couldn’t answer, more than just by spitting, and
there we lay waiting our turn and watching the sun
striking fuller on the lagoon through the door space.</p>

<p>“I could see the schooner lying there at anchor, but
not a soul could I see on board her; the crew were either
down below or had been murdered. As I was looking
at her I heard Heffernan give a grunt, then I saw that
he was sitting up and that his hands were free. He’d
been working away, saying nothing, and he’d managed
to get the cocoanut fibre rope free of his wrists; a
minute after, he’d got his feet loose, and then he
turned to me and it didn’t take more than five minutes
to make me a free man like himself.</p>

<p>“That being done we set to work on the back wall
of the shack, pulling aside the wattles and tearing out
the grass binding till we were free at last and out into
the thick growth, which was mostly mammee apple
and cassia mixed up with pandanus and cocoanut trees.</p>

<p>“What made us bother to break free from the shack,
Lord only knows. There was no use getting free,
seeing we were on an atoll and would be hunted down
like rats once Tawela and her crowd got wind that we
were loose; anyhow, we’d worked like niggers and just
as if our lives had depended on it, and now in the
bushes we were crawling along on our bellies to put
as big a distance as we could between ourselves and
that crowd&mdash;as if it mattered!</p>

<p>“We worked along, taking the line of bushes
towards the reef opening, and all the time to the left
of us we could hear the breaking of the swell on the
outer beach, whilst to the right of us we could see bits
of the lagoon now and then through the branches.</p>

<p>“The strangest feeling I’ve ever felt was being
stuck like that between the free sea and that locked-in
lagoon.</p>

<p>“Prison on one side, so to say, and an open road
on the other.</p>

<p>“Well, there we were, the sun getting higher in
the sky, and the Kanakas sure to be beating the
bushes after us as soon as they found we’d broke loose,
but we didn’t say a word on the matter, only went on
crawling till we’d reached the last of the trees and
thick stuff. From there the coral ran naked to the
break in the reef.</p>

<p>“We hadn’t more than reached so far when the
hellnation of a hullabaloo broke out behind us, and we
thought they’d found we’d escaped, but that wasn’t
so, as we discovered in a minute, for chancing to look
towards the opening, we saw the top canvas of a
schooner away beyond the northernmost pierhead.
We reckoned she was two or three mile off, and, crawling
along the coral on our bellies till we’d got a clear
view of the sea, there she was, right enough, making
for the break, the light wind spilling and filling her
canvas. She hadn’t much more than steerage way.</p>

<p>“Then we looked back. We couldn’t see the
village because of the trees, but we could see the
<i>Mary Waters</i> lying there at anchor out in the lagoon,
and canoes all about her and chaps swarming on
board of her.</p>

<p>“‘See that,’ said Heffernan, ‘all that hullabaloo
wasn’t about us. I doubt if they’ve found we’ve
escaped yet.’</p>

<p>“‘What are they doing round the schooner?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘Lord knows,’ says he, ‘but we’ll soon see.’</p>

<p>“We did. Those devils were used to the game of
sinking ships and slaughtering sailor men; they’d
most likely got all the trade goods they wanted off
the schooner by this, and now we saw them passing
a tow rope from the bow to one of the canoes and we
heard the noise of the winch picking up the anchor
chain.</p>

<p>“‘They’re not going to sink her at her moorings,’
said Heffernan, ‘too shallow. Look, they’re towing
her to a deeper part of the lagoon.’</p>

<p>“That was so, and as we watched we saw she was
getting deeper in the water even as she was towed;
they must have begun the job of sinking her the
minute the schooner was sighted, forgetting like fools
that the chaps coming up would have been sure to sight
her spars, or maybe risking even that rather than have
the newcomers see the bloody work that had been
done on deck.</p>

<p>“You can sink a ship quicker than clean her sometimes.
Well, there it was, and suddenly the old
<i>Mary Waters</i> gave a dive, and dipped her bowsprit
under. I saw her shiver like a dog, and then the stern
went, the main hatch cover blowing off from air
pressure as soon as the decks were awash. After that
she went like a stone till there was nothing left of her
but a case or two floating about and a bit of grating.</p>

<p>“Then we crawled back among the trees and held
a council of war, as you might say, but we couldn’t
fix on anything to do but lay still and wait our chances.
We reckoned the fellows in the schooner were sure to
come ashore armed, and we’d have time to warn them
before they were set on. Our worst chance was that
the Kanakas might find us before the schooner was in
or the chaps come ashore, but there was no use
bothering about that, and there we lay waiting and
listening till the fore canvas of the schooner showed
at the break, and in she came riding the full flood,
every sail drawing to the wind that was freshening up.</p>

<p>“When I saw her full view I nearly leapt out of my
skin. She was the <i>Greyhound</i>. Buck, as I found
afterwards, had put into Papeete, heard of our expedition
and me being with it, and, the old whaling
chap offering to give him our port of destination for
two bottles of whisky, closed on the offer and lit
after us. He was anxious to pick up with me and
make friends, and maybe he was anxious to have a
hand in the coral business as well, no knowing; anyhow,
here he was bulling along across the lagoon and
evidently making to drop his anchor close to the village.</p>

<p>“‘Come on,’ I says to Heffernan, ‘follow me.’
We made back through the thick stuff, taking the track
we’d come by, and we hadn’t more’n reached the
sight of Tawela’s house through the trees when we
heard the anchor chain go.</p>

<p>“I reckon the damn fool Kanakas had been so busy
with the sinking of the schooner and then the <i>Greyhound</i>
coming in, that they’d forgot to look to see if
we were still safely tied up. Anyhow, the whole
crowd were down on the beach to meet the boat
that was coming off, and making sure of that, I took
a peep into Tawela’s house to see if there was any
clubs or spears handy for arming ourselves, and there
I see Tawela’s son hiding a long knife under some
matting. We went in; he was too scared to yell, and
shoving him in a corner, we stripped up the matting,
and there were our revolvers, a couple of knives and
half a dozen short stabbing spears, all bloody with
the blood of Sellers.</p>

<p>“We kicked him out before us, and, with the guns
in our hands, down we marched to the beach.</p>

<div class='secn'>IV</div>

<p>“Buck Slane had landed, he and four of his men,
and every man with a Winchester.</p>

<p>“Tawela and her crowd were round them, all
friendly as pie and wagging their tails, and so busy
pretending to be innocent and God-fearing Kanakas
they didn’t notice us till we were almost on them;
for a moment I thought they were going to show fight,
but when they saw the guns in our hands they boiled
down.</p>

<p>“I clapped my gun to Tawela’s head, and called Buck
to tie her hands behind her&mdash;we hadn’t time to say
good-day to each other, just that&mdash;and Buck, tumbling
to the truth of the matter, whips a big pocket handkerchief
from his pocket, and one of his men does
the binding. As he was binding her he says, ‘Look
at her hands,’ and there, sure enough, was blood
dried on her hands, the blood of Sellers calling out
for revenge.</p>

<p>“Then, whilst the crowd stood quiet, I gave Buck
the facts in four words. He made a signal with his
arms to the schooner, and off comes another boat
with the mate and four more Kanakas, all armed.</p>

<p>“Then Buck took command, and leaving Tawela
with a chap and orders to blow her brains out if she
so much as sneezed, we drove that whole crowd along
the beach right to the break of the lagoon and left
them there with four gunmen covering them. Then
we came back.</p>

<p>“We searched round and found what was left of
Sellers among the bushes, then we set to.</p>

<p>“‘They’re unfortunate heathens,’ says Buck, ‘but
they’ve got to be taught,’ and with that he set fire
to Tawela’s house with his own hands. We burnt
every house, we smashed everything we could smash,
and we broke the canoes to flinders, fishing gear and
spears and everything went, so there was nothing left
of that population but the people.</p>

<p>“That will learn them,’ says Buck. Then he
collected his men, and bundling Tawela into a boat
with a parcel of pink coral we found in a shack back of
her house, we pushed off. Ridley, the mate, was for
shooting her&mdash;seeing the evidence on her hands&mdash;and
slinging the body in the lagoon, but Buck said he was
going to give her a decent trial when our minds were
cool, and there was lots of time, anyway, after we’d
put out. Buck, ever since his business with Sru,
had been against doing things in a hurry, specially
when it came to killing, so she was had on board and
given in charge of two of the Kanaka crew. Then
we got the hook up and out we put.</p>

<p>“The Kanakas were still herded at the end near the
break, and as we passed through, knowing we’d got
their Queen on board, they all set up a shout, ‘Tawela,
Tawela’ like the crying of sea gulls, and that was the
last we heard of them.</p>

<p>“Then, with the ship on her course, and the Kanaka
bo’sun in charge of the deck, we got down to the cabin
and started our court-martial.</p>

<p>“She deserved hanging, there were no two words
about that. And I reckon it was more superstition
about killing a woman than humanity, but maybe I’m
wrong; anyhow, Buck brought out his idea, which
was to take her to Sydney and have her tried there.</p>

<p>“We’d been going at it for an hour or so, when the
mate was called on deck and comes back in a minute
or two in a tearing rage.</p>

<p>“‘That wild cat,’ says he, ‘has been asking for food
and won’t eat bully beef; says anything that comes out
of a shell is tabu to her, turtle or oysters or shell fish,
and she reckons canned stuff is the same since it’s in
a tin shell. I expect she’s had lots of experience
in canned stuff seeing all the ships she’s wrecked.
What’s to be done with her?’</p>

<p>“‘Give her biscuits,’ says Buck, ‘and there’s lots
of bananas on board.’</p>

<p>“Off the mate goes and back he comes to the conference,
but we could fix up nothing that night, Buck
still holding out for a proper trial at Sydney, and
we pointing out that English or American law would
be sure to let a woman escape. It stood like that till
next morning, when Buck, coming down to breakfast,
says: ‘Boys, I’ve got an idea.’</p>

<div class='secn'>V</div>

<p>“He’d struck an idea in the night of how to dispose
of Tawela. Buck had a fine knowledge of the Kanaka
mind, and when he’d explained his idea to us I allowed
it was a peach, if what he said was true.</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard tell of the Swatchway&mdash;the
Scours some call it? It’s an island, or more truly
speaking a big lump of reef with half a dozen cocoanut
trees on it lying south of the Australs about four
hundred and fifty miles from the steamer track between
Auckland and Tahiti. It’s got reefs round it all
spouting like whales, and ships’ captains give it a big
wide berth.</p>

<p>“Well, Buck’s plan was to land Tawela on the
Scours; there’s water there according to the Pacific
Directory, and Buck said he wasn’t going to maroon
her without grub. He’d give her six months’ grub&mdash;canned.
Bully beef and so on with biscuits in tins.
If she starved herself to death in the middle of plenty
then it wouldn’t be our fault. He said he’d come back
in six months, and if she was alive he’d take her back
home, said she was only an ignorant Kanaka and he
reckoned six months’ punishment would fill the bill,
and if she chose to kill herself, why, then it would
be Providence not us that did the business.</p>

<p>“Ridley, at first go off, flew out against this till
Buck quieted him, asking who was master of the
schooner, and whether he wanted to be logged for
insubordination; the course was changed to sou’-sou’-west
and two days later we raised the Scours.</p>

<p>“There were six cocoanut trees there, all bearing,
so we cut them down and brought the nuts on board,
then we landed Tawela and her provisions with a
can opener, showing her how to use it. There was
a fresh water pond in the coral, so she couldn’t want
for water, and there we left her.</p>

<p>“We made for Suva and sold that coral, not getting
near the price we thought to, and then we ran a cargo
to Auckland.</p>

<p>“I’d noticed for some time Buck wasn’t the man
he used to be, and one night it come out. ‘I’ve got
something on my mind,’ he says, ‘it’s that dam
Kanaka. Can’t help thinking about her. My conscience
is clear enough,’ he says, ‘for she deserved
her gruel, but I can’t help thinking of her&mdash;wonder
if she’s dead.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it’s ten to one she’s either broke her tabu
or some ship has taken her off by this,’ I says to ease
him, for I saw that being a good-hearted chap, and
imaginative as most Irishmen are, the thing was hitting
him as it never hit me.</p>

<p>“Buck shakes his head and falls back into himself
and says no more, and time goes on, till one day
when we were on the run to Papeete with a mixed
cargo, seeing that the chap was making an old man
of himself over the business, I says, ‘S’pose we run
down to the Scours now instead of on the voyage
back as you’d fixed, and see what’s become of that
woman?’</p>

<p>“His face lit up, but he pretended to hang off
for a while; then he falls in with the idea, and we
shifted the helm, raising the place four days later
and dropping anchor outside the reefs four months
and eight days from the time we’d left it.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a sign to be seen of anyone on the
island, so Buck tells me to take a boat and look; he
hadn’t the heart to go himself and said so, plump,
and off I put, leaving the boat’s crew with the boat
on the beach and tramping across the coral on the
look-out for signs.</p>

<p>“I found the canned stuff. There had evidently
been a big wind and blown the stuff about, and I
found it here and there, but not one empty can could
I find or one that had been opened, then, in a dip of the
coral I found a skull, the black hair still sticking to
it, and a backbone and ribs&mdash;the birds make a skeleton
of a corpse in no time on a place like that; I reckon
I could have found the whole skeleton if I’d hunted,
but I didn’t. I put back for the schooner and came
on board laughing.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I said, ‘she’s done us. You and your
talk of Kanakas not breaking their tabu; why, half
the tins are opened and empty, and she’s gone, took
off by some ship.’</p>

<p>“‘Thank God,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“That lie of mine lifted the black dog right off
his back, and to his dying day he never knew he’d
killed that woman as sure as if he’d shot her with
a gun. He was as cheerful as a magpie all the rest
of that voyage, and so was I. You see I’d heard
Sellers screaming whilst those brutes were doing him
in and Buck hadn’t.</p>

<p>“That’s all I know about tabu, but it’s first-hand
knowledge, personal experience as you might say.”</p>

<p>He ceased, and through the night came the voices
of fish spearers from the reef and the far rumble of
the surf, and from the back premises the voice of
Tahori singing some old song of an Island world
whose brilliancy breaks sometimes to reveal the
strangest phantoms from the Past.</p>

</h2>

<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>Do you know that fiction, without side-tracking
interest, can often teach a man what he will
never learn in a class-room or from a text-book? It
can, and the lesson sticks, because the human mind
is so constituted that it will retain and assimilate
a moral wrapped up in a story, whereas the moral
naked and unadorned would be forgotten in fifteen
minutes or rejected at once.</p>

<p>I wonder how many men have been saved from
selling old lamps for new by the story of Aladdin!</p>

<p>I, like hosts of other men, am a nervy and imaginative
individual, and the devil of the thing is that with
us our imagination is our worst enemy, keeps us awake
at night counting up our losses instead of our profits,
fills us with fantastic fears of the future, and, should
any of us ever find ourselves in an incriminating
position&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;would, were we innocent,
ten to one make us look or act like criminals.</p>

<p>Here is the story of a man who acted like an ass,
a highly moral married man whose imagination
betrayed him, the story of Billy Broke of Los Angeles,
told me by Brent.</p>

<p>Brent had a little fishing boat he kept at a slip
near Circular Wharf and he and I used often to go out
fishing in Sydney Harbour. One day we were out
late, fishing off Farm Cove, so late that on our return
a huge moon was rising, flooding the harbour and city
with its light. We left the boat tied up in charge
of the wharf keeper and tramped off with our fish.
Coming up along Halkin Street we saw something
like a bundle of old clothes lying in the moonlight
right before us, and when we got to it we found it
was a dead Chink.</p>

<p>It was a narrow street of tenement houses and not
a soul to be seen. There was a big Labour demonstration
on that night, so I suppose the inhabitants were
all off demonstrating and that accounted for the
desolation of the place.</p>

<p>Brent knelt down to inspect. Then he rose up:</p>

<p>“Stabbed,” said he, “and as dead as mutton.”</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Brent, “we can’t be of any use to
him, and we don’t want to be mixed up in the business&mdash;come
along.”</p>

<p>He took me by the arm and led me off. He was a
practical man and right enough, I suppose, we could
give no clue, the murderer, whoever he might be, was
well away, a thousand to one he was a brother Chink
and we knew all the bother there would be over the
inquest,&mdash;still I felt a qualm, but it was so slight
I easily drowned it in a whisky and soda at a bar
we stopped at. Then I went home and went to
bed and put out the light, and with the darkness
the moonlit street showed up before my mind’s eye&mdash;and
the Chink.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” I thought, “suppose someone saw us
leaving that street, suppose by any chance we got
connected with the business&mdash;what would people
say? Might they say we had committed the
murder?” Absolute nonsense, but there you are,
my imagination had got away with me. I couldn’t
sleep, and next morning when I met Brent he asked
me what was wrong with me and I told him. He
took me out for a sail in the harbour where we spent
the day cruising about, and after luncheon Brent
tackled me over the stupidity of “fancying things.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of fancying things?” said Brent,
“ain’t there enough troubles in the world without
breeding them. Suppose you <i>were</i> had over that
Chink, where’s the damage, you didn’t kill him&mdash;and
you ain’t going to be. Forget it. Lord o’ mercy,
I’ve seen more guys fooled by their fancies than I
can remember the names of. Did I ever tell you of
Billy Broke? Brooke was the real name, only some
fool of an English ancestor or another left out one
of the o’s, so the poor chap was saddled with a nameplate
only fit for a hoodoo. Nature not to be behind
in the business, fitted him with a set of nerves and
an imagination worse than yours and then turned
him out into the cold world to make his living. On
top of everything he was pious beyond the ordinary,
bashful beyond believing and trusting in every man,
which isn’t a quality which makes for success in
American business circles.</p>

<p>“He’d gone bankrupt four or five times when
the Almighty, thinking maybe it was a shame that one
of his creatures should be used like that, married him
to a common-sense woman with a bit of money and
they started a dry goods store in Los Angeles and
would have done well enough only for Billy’s nerves
and imagination.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t speculate a bit in his business for
fear of ruining himself, an’ his fear of what was going
to happen in the future took all the pep and energy
out of him. Worst of it was he would be boss of the
show and not leave things to his wife. I’m not
meaning anything personal, but chaps with high-geared
nerves and X-ray imaginations generally have
a pretty good opinion of themselves in private.
Billy had, and the result was that he’d near brought
the dry goods store to bankruptcy when one day a
wholesale firm in ’Frisco began to give trouble over
a bill that was owing and Billy determined to go
and interview them.</p>

<p>“Mrs. B. wanted to go, but he wouldn’t let her,
and the unfortunate woman, knowing the fool he
was, got in such a temper, she wouldn’t even pack
his grip. The hired girl did the packing. She was
Irish and given to mistakes, one of them dreamy,
acushla sort of red-headed Irishwomen with her
heart on her sleeve and her head in the clouds, regular
at attending mass and smashing china and dependable
to shove anything that came handy into the pie she
was making or the bag she was packing.</p>

<p>“The Irish girl did the packing and Billy with the
grip in his hand kissed the back of his wife’s neck, for
she wouldn’t give him her lips, and started off for
the station. He got to ’Frisco without losing himself
and put up at the ‘Paris.’</p>

<p>“Now that day me and Slane were at Long Wharf,
’Frisco, on board the <i>Greyhound</i> ready to put out.
We’d got five thousand dollars’ worth of trade under
the hatch, and we were bound for Nanuti in the
Gilberts, that’s to say right under the Line.</p>

<p>“We were due out next morning at sun up, and
that night, under a blazing big moon we were sitting
on deck having a smoke and talking things over.
Long Wharf was pretty quiet and you couldn’t more’n
hear the drunks and such yelling in Third and Fourth
Streets. There was a timber schooner outside of us
and we could hear a fellow snoring in her cabin and
a big clock somewhere striking eleven. The strokes
were all equally loud, which showed there was no
wind to speak of, and Buck was wondering if we’d
get enough in the morning to take us out when along
the wharfside comes running a chap, and, seeing us
there on deck in the moonlight and the sparks of
our cigars, he comes bounding down the gang plank
and lands on the deck on his hands and knees without
losing grip of a parcel he was carrying.</p>

<p>“‘Save me,’ cries the chap. ‘Get me out of
’Frisco, the police are after me.’ Then he goes limp
and Buck bends down and stirs him up.</p>

<p>“‘Drunk,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“He was, and battered at that. His coat was torn
up the back, he was mud all over and his hat was
gone, and yet, for all that, he looked to have been
respectable. You can’t batter the respectability out
of a man in five minutes, not even if you roll him
in the gutter and fill him with drink, this chap’s
hands were clean where they weren’t dirty, and I
could see his nails had been attended to, his pants
were muddy and had a tear in them, but they weren’t
frayed at the heels and the cloth was good.</p>

<p>“‘What are we going to do with him?’ I asks.</p>

<p>“Buck scratches his head for a minute, then he
says:</p>

<p>“‘Get him below.’</p>

<p>“I was none too anxious for extra cargo of that
sort, but I knew by Buck’s voice he wasn’t in the
humour for arguing, and, fearing that maybe the
police might come along and find the chap and hold
us up maybe next morning as witnesses of Lord
knows what, I grabbed the guy by the heels whilst
Buck took the head and between us we slithered
him down below and shoved him in a spare bunk,
putting his parcel beside him.</p>

<p>“We reckoned that maybe he’d have slept his liquor
off before morning, and we could give him a wash up
and shove him ashore.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>“I got into my own bunk and slept like a dead
policeman till Buck dragged me out.</p>

<p>“‘Tug’s along,’ says he, ‘and there’s a good wind,
but I can’t wake that blighter. He’s still in the
arms of Bacchus and I’m just going to take him along,
Bacchus and all.’</p>

<p>“I came on deck and there was a little tinpot tug
hauling the timber schooner out so’s to free us, with
the dawn breaking over the bay.</p>

<p>“‘But Lord, Buck!’ I says. ‘What are you going
to do with him if you take him along, he’s no mascot
by the look of him, and no sailor-man neither. What
are you going to do with him?’</p>

<p>“‘Save him from the police,’ says he, ‘and from
liquor and make a man of him or kill him, he’s no
tough, by his face, just a softy that’s got into bad
hands maybe, or just run crooked because of the
drink. Curse the drink,’ says Buck, ‘I’ve seen its
black work in my family and that’s why I’ve always
steered clear of it, and if it was only to spite John
Barleycorn I’d take a dozen guys like that, let alone
one.’</p>

<p>“I didn’t argue. I had my hands full directing
the crew, and I had it in my mind that Buck was
as keen of cheating the Penitentiary as he was of
spiting John Barleycorn. Like most Irishmen he
had a mortal hatred of policemen and prisons, and
I don’t blame him, neither.</p>

<p>“We were kept on deck till we were clear of the
bar and running on a sou’-west course, doing seven
knots, with the sea piling up and more wind coming,
then I dropped below for a cup of coffee and a bite
of food, and looking at the chap in the bunk saw
he was still snoring.</p>

<p>“The parcel had dropped out of the bunk owing
to the rolling in crossing the bar, and the brown
paper covering had got a bit loose and I couldn’t
for the life of me help poking round with my finger and
loosening it a bit more so’s to have a look at what
might be inside. I was thinking it might be banknotes
or boodle of some sort, but what I come on was
a female’s silk petticoat. I was more shook up
than if I’d hit on a rattlesnake, and, calling Buck down,
I says to him, ‘Buck, this sleeping beauty of yours
has been murdering a female.’ That’s how the
business struck me first. Why else should he have
been running away with the thing and the police
after him?</p>

<p>“Buck takes one squint, then he begins the Sherlock
Holmes business, looking for dagger marks
and bloodstains, but there weren’t none, the article
looked pretty new, with nothing a Sherlock Holmes
could lay hold of but the letters J.B. worked in black
thread very small on the band of it, and no doubt
the initials of the party owning the concern. Buck
puts the thing away in a locker and we sits down to
breakfast, arguing and talking all the time, the professor
of somnology snoring away in his bunk, the
schooner getting further to sea and the sea piling
bigger behind her, with the wind rising to a tearing
gale.</p>

<p>“I was kept on deck all that morning, at the wheel
most of the time, for we were running before it and if
she’d broached to we’d have gone truck over keel
to perdition.</p>

<p>“Buck comes up at eight bells, saying the petticoat
man had woke up wanting to know where he
was and asking to be taken to Los Angeles. I didn’t
bother about the chap, didn’t see him till next morning,
when I turned out to find the gale gone into
a six-knot breeze and Buck and him sitting at
breakfast.</p>

<p>“He’d washed and brushed and looked more like
a human being, and he’d given up wantin’ to be
taken to Los Angeles and he’d settled down to his
gruel.</p>

<p>“We were keen to have his story out of him and
know what the crime was, but we had no time for
tale-telling with the damage on deck, for we’d lost
several spars in the blow, so we just left him to
smoke and think over his sins and didn’t tackle
him till two days later, when he told us the whole
yarn right off, and without winking, so’s that we
couldn’t help believing him.</p>

<p>“This is it, as far as I can remember, with nothing
left out that matters.</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>“Billy Broke was his name and he’d left Los
Angeles as I’ve told you on a visit to ’Frisco to see a
wholesale firm on some business. He put up at the
‘Paris’ and went to his room to change his necktie and
brush his hair, and when he opened his grip to fetch
out the tie and the hairbrush, he come on a woman’s
red silk petticoat rolled up and stuck in anyhow.
At first he thought it was his wife’s, but he couldn’t
remember ever seeing her in possession of such a
garment, she being a woman of quiet tastes and not
given to violent colours. Then he thought the
thing must have been shoved in for fun by some
joking young chaps that had been on the train. The
more he considered this, the more he was sure of it,
and down he sits to think things over.</p>

<p>“First of all he says to himself that if the thing
was shoved in by them guys for fun it must have
been stolen, then it came to him that maybe they
didn’t put it in for fun but to get rid of it as evidence
against them of some crime they’d committed. That
made him sweat, but he got a clutch on himself,
telling himself it was only in magazine stories things
like that happened and that the chances were it
belonged to his wife. Then he told himself that no
matter who it belonged to or who put it there, he’d
got to get rid of it.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t risk bringing it back home, not
much, and he wouldn’t risk keeping it an instant
longer in his possession for fear of detectives arriving
whilst it was still in his possession, so down he goes
to the office and begs, borrows or steals a piece of
brown paper and a yard and a half of string and
back he comes to his room and wraps the evidence
up and ties the string round it.</p>

<p>“‘There,’ says Billy to himself, ‘that’s done.
Now the only thing I’ve got to do is take it out and
lose it. Just throw it away. Some poor woman
will pick it up and grateful she’ll be for it.’</p>

<p>“He comes down and goes out with the parcel
under his arm and then he finds himself in the street.
He’d thought to drop the parcel in the street casually
as he walked along, it seemed the easiest thing in
the world to do, but no sooner had he left the hotel
with the parcel under his arm than he felt that everyone
was watching him. That wasn’t stupidity either.
Everyone was watching him. Everyone in every
street is watching everyone else, doing it unbeknown
to themselves most of the time, but doing it; it’s
maybe a habit that has come down to us from the
time we were hunters, and our lives depended on our
eyes, but it’s there and if you fall down in any street
half a dozen people will see you fall who otherwise
would never have known of your existence, passing
you without seeing you, consciously.</p>

<p>“That truth hit Billy between the eyes. He felt
if he were to drop that parcel, not only would some
guy see him drop it, but he’d know he’d dropped it
purposefully, so he walks along with it under his arm
trying to find an empty street, and somehow or another
failing, till he comes on a narrow lane, and ‘Here’s
my chance,’ says he and dives down it. Half way
down, with no one in front or behind, he drops the
parcel and walks on, but he couldn’t help turning his
head like a fool, and there behind him, just come
into the lane, was a man. The parcel was between
Billy and the man, and Billy in a flash saw that the
man would know he’d dropped it seeing Billy was
walking away from it, not towards it. So, having
turned his head, he had to complete the business
and turn back and pick up the durned thing and
walk on with it. He was in Market Street now and
beginning to set his teeth. There was a good few
people going and coming and they all seemed so
busy and full of themselves that Billy took heart,
and, walking along close to the houses, dropped the
thing again. He didn’t turn his head this time,
but just walked on, stopping here and there to look
in at the shop windows and feeling he’d done the
trick this time. He’d gone a good way and was
looking in at a jeweller’s thinking which of the rings
he’d buy for his wife if he had the money, when an
old chap comes panting up to him with the parcel.</p>

<p>“‘I saw you drop it,’ says the old guy, and I ran
after you with it, but you walk so quick I couldn’t
catch you.’ Then he has a fit of coughing and Billy
sees he’s nearly in rags and hands out a quarter and
takes the parcel. Billy was beginning to find out
the truth that if you want to lose a thing that’s of
no value to you, you can’t, not in a city anyhow, but
he was only beginning, else he’d have quitted the
business right there and have knuckled under to that
petticoat.</p>

<p>“Instead of that what does he do but go on with
his peregrinations and his fool attempts to get rid
of the thing, he makes it a present to a beggar woman
and when she’d seen what was in it, she runs after him
saying she’s taking no stolen goods and suggesting a
dollar commission for not showing it to the police.</p>

<p>“Then getting along for four in the afternoon, Billy,
feeling he’s married to the thing, begins to celebrate
his connubial state with drinks. He wasn’t used to
the stuff and he goes from saloon to saloon, warming
up as he went and making more attempts at divorce
till he strikes a bar tender notorious for his married
unblessedness, offers the thing as a present for the
B.T.’s wife and gets kicked flying into the street when
a policeman picks him and his parcel up and starts
them off again on their ambulations.</p>

<p>“The drink was working in him now strong&mdash;you
see, he’d always been an abstemious man and you never
know what whisky will do with a guy like that till
it’s done with him. Billy cruises into another bar,
planks down a quarter, swallows a high ball, gets a
clutch on himself and starts on the king of all jags.
He wasn’t trying to lose the parcel now. He was
proud of it. He remembered in one saloon undoing
it and showing the petticoat to an admiring audience.
He remembered in another saloon saying the thing
was full of bonds and banknotes. Then he was
down in the dock area tumbling into gutters and
singing songs. Chaps tried to rob him of the thing
and he fought them like a wild cat. He’d begun the
day with the parcel sticking to him, and he was
ending the day by sticking to the parcel and resisting
all attempts on it by armed force, so to speak. Then
he believed he had a dust up with some Chinks who
tried to nab the thing and there seemed to be police
mixed up with it, for it ended with him running to
escape policemen. Then he couldn’t remember anything
more, and we told him how he had come running
along the dockside till he struck the <i>Greyhound</i> and
came bounding on board, as per invoice.</p>

<div class='secn'>IV</div>

<p>“That was the yarn Billy spun, and there he sat
when he’d finished asking us what he was to do.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I says to him, ‘you’re asking that question
a bit too late; to begin with, you should never have
trusted yourself alone in ’Frisco with them nerves of
yours. Second, you went the wrong way about getting
rid of the thing.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, did I?’ said Billy. ‘And how would you
have done&mdash;put yourself in my position, and what
would you have done to get rid of it?’</p>

<p>“That flummoxed me.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I said, ‘to begin with, I wouldn’t have
been such an ass as to want to get rid of it.’</p>

<p>“‘S’posing you were,’ said he, ‘and I allow I was
an ass to fancy all them things, but supposing you
were, will you tell me where I went wrong? Wouldn’t
you have done everything I did just as I did it? Of
course you would. I tell you I was fixed to that thing
by bad luck and I only got rid of it after it had done
me in with the drink.’</p>

<p>“‘But you haven’t got rid of it,’ says Buck.</p>

<p>“‘Whach you mean?’ asks Billy, his hair standing
on end.</p>

<p>“‘You brought it on board,’ says Buck, and he
goes to the locker and takes the parcel out. Billy
looked at it, took it in his hands and turned it over.</p>

<p>“‘Then he says: ‘That does me.’ He says no
more than that. The life seemed to go out of him for
a bit as if the hunch had come on him that it wasn’t
no use to fight any more.</p>

<p>“‘I says to Buck: ‘Come on up on deck and leave
him with the durned thing,’ and up we went and there
we saw a big freighter pounding along and coming
up from south’ard, ’Frisco bound and making to pass
us close.</p>

<p>“‘There’s his chance,’ says Buck; ‘run down and
fetch him up and we’ll flag her to stop, it’s better than
taking him off to hell or Timbuctoo, seeing he’s a
married man.’</p>

<p>“Down I went and up I brought him. There was
a fair sea still running, but nothing to make a bother
about, and we could easy have got him off in a boat.
But do you think that chap would go, not he; he
said he’d sure be drowned if he put off in a boat in
that sea, said the thing was out to drown him if it
could. Then he went below and got into his bunk
with his inamorata, and we let the freighter pass,
and that was his last chance of getting to Los Angeles
for many a long day.</p>

<p>“I was pretty sick with him, so was Buck. It wasn’t
so much because he was afraid of drowning as because
he was afraid of being drowned by that rotten parcel,
but we weren’t so free of superstitions ourselves as to
be too hard on the poor chap, so we didn’t do more
than make his life a hell till he was ashamed of himself
to the soles of his boots and taking a hand in the
working of the ship. We wanted to shy parcel and
petticoat overboard, but he wouldn’t let us. We’d
shown him the initials on the belt of the thing and he
said they were his wife’s and it was plain now that
some mistake had been made in packing it among
his things by the servant maid he gave us the specification
of. He said he reckoned he’d keep it to
bring back to her, so she might know his story was
true.</p>

<p>“But it was many a day before he was likely to see
Los Angeles again and so we told him.</p>

<div class='secn'>V</div>

<p>“From the day we passed that freighter till the
day we lifted Howland Island, which lies nor’-west
of Nanuti, we only sighted three ships hull down and
beyond signalling.</p>

<p>“After passing Howland we passed a brig bound
for Java and a freighter from Rangoon bound for
South American ports&mdash;Nothing for anywhere near
’Frisco.</p>

<p>“Billy like a good many landsmen seemed to fancy
that ships were all over the sea close as plums in a
pudding. He got to know different by the time we
reached Nanuti and, more than that, he got to know
that every ship wasn’t bound for ’Frisco.</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ he says one day, ‘if I’ve got to wait for
a ship back,’ he says, ‘I’m thinking it’s an old man
I’ll be before we sight one.’</p>

<p>“‘And you’re thinking right,’ says Buck. ‘You
had your chance and you missed it because the sea
was a bit rough and your head was stuffed with that
blessed petticoat and the idea it was going to drown
you. You’ll just have to stick to the old <i>Greyhound</i>
till she fetches up again at Long Wharf and that’s
God knows when, for we don’t run by time-table.’</p>

<p>“And that was the fact; we touched at Nanuti
and discharged cargo and took on copra. Then we
came along down by the New Hebrides and shaving
New Caledonia put into Sydney and discharged and
took a cargo along to Auckland, and then from North
Island we took a cargo down for Dunedin. The
only way to make money with ships is to know where
to go for your cargoes. Buck had some sort of instinct
that way and he was backed with friends in the shipping
trade, but it wasn’t for eight months from starting
that he got the chance of a cargo to ’Frisco, and it
wasn’t till two months later that we passed the
whistling buoy and saw the tumble of the bar.</p>

<p>“I looked at Billy that morning and I thought
to myself that it was worth it to him. He looked
twice the man he was when he fetched on board and,
more than that, he could handle sails and steer and take
an observation as good as me or Buck, besides which
Buck had treated him well about payment and he’d
have a good few dollars waiting for him when we tied
up at the wharf.</p>

<p>“Which was that day. I’d business which kept
me running about all the day after and it wasn’t
till the day after that Billy took heart and come to
me and asked me to go with him to Los Angeles so’s
to break him to his wife, so to speak.</p>

<p>“I’d got to like the chap and I agreed. I won’t
say that I wasn’t anxious to see how he’d make out
when he got back and what Mrs. Billy would say to
him, but however that may be, I packed a bag and
Billy shouldered his dunnage and off we started by
the night train, getting into Los Angeles next morning.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t as big a place in those days as it is now.
We left our traps at the station and set off on foot to
find Mrs. B., Billy back in his old nervous state and
almost afraid to ask questions as to how his wife and
the shop had been doing in his absence. The shop
was on Pine Tree Avenue, and half way along to it
Billy’s nerves got so bad we stopped at a restaurant
for some breakfast, fixing it that I should go off after
the meal and hunt up Mrs. B. and find out what had
become of her. Billy could scarcely eat his food for
talking of what might have happened to her, fearing
maybe she might have committed suicide or gone
bankrupt or starved to death or gone out of her mind
at the loss of him. The woman that ran the restaurant
served us at table and it came to me sudden to ask
her did she know anything of a Mrs. Broke of Pine
Tree Avenue who had a dry goods store.</p>

<p>“‘Burstall, you mean?’ said she. ‘She’s married
again since Broke ran off and left her. He was a little
no good chap and skipped with all the money they had,
which wasn’t much, and she got a divorce against
him for illegally deserting her or incompatibility of
temper or something and ran the store herself and
made it pay. Y’ see, he’d been boss of the thing up
to that, and near made it bankrupt, but once she
took charge, she made it pay. I’ve never seen Broke,
I only came to the town six months ago, but I’ve
seen Burstall often. He’s a fine man and between
them they’re making that store hum.’</p>

<p>“I got Billy on his feet and out of that place and
wanted to get him to the station to see about the next
train for ’Frisco, but he said he wanted to see things
for himself and make sure; so the funeral procession
started for Pine Tree Avenue.</p>

<p>“‘That’s the place,’ said Billy, pointing to a big
shop with J. Burstall and Co. painted along the front
in gold letters. ‘There’s my old home&mdash;Well, I wish
her happiness.</p>

<p>“That seemed to me a pretty weak thing to do, and
I says to him: ‘Ain’t you going to kick Burstall?’</p>

<p>“He didn’t hear me, he was so occupied looking
at his old home, till a big fellow in his shirt-sleeves
comes out and begins looking at the contents of the
shop window to see how they showed.</p>

<p>“Billy goes up to him.</p>

<p>“‘You belong to this store?’ says Billy.</p>

<p>“‘Yep,’ says the chap.</p>

<p>“‘Then will you give Mrs. Broke, I mean Burstall,
this parcel,’ says Billy, ‘and ask her to see me about
it, there’s been a big mistake.’</p>

<p>“‘No use troubling her,’ says the big chap. ‘I’m
Burstall and running this store. What’s this you’ve
brought back&mdash;we don’t change no goods once
bought.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s a petticoat,’ says Billy.</p>

<p>“‘Well, what’s wrong with it?’ asks the other,
taking the goods.</p>

<p>“‘What’s wrong with it!’ cries Billy, then he begins
to laugh like a crazy man, till I thought Burstall would
have gone for the both of us.</p>

<p>“‘Come on, Billy,’ I says, catching him by the arm,
then I turns to Burstall: ‘You big stiff,’ I says,
for all my bristles were up at the beefy look of the
chap and the carried on. ‘You big stiff,’ I
says, ‘for two pins,’ I says, ‘I’d kick you from
here to Santa Barbara.’</p>

<p>“Burstall drops the parcel to go for me, when along
comes a policeman, and explanations begins; Burstall
saying how we’d been trying to land him some old
goods we’d never bought in his shop and the policeman
asking us for our address.</p>

<p>“‘We don’t belong here,’ I says. ‘We’ve come
from ’Frisco.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says the bull, ‘if I find you about town
trying any more of your dodges by noon to-day.
I’ll run you in, sure as my name’s Bill Adams. Pick
up your parcel and off with you.’</p>

<p>“I picked the damned thing up and stuffed it in
the side pocket of Billy’s coat and led him off, the bull
following us two or three blocks to make sure we
were moving.</p>

<p>“We found a train was starting at the station,
and I got Billy in, all broke down. Getting towards
’Frisco he pulled himself together, he’d been thinking
a lot on the journey, and I got the surprise of my
life to find him cheerful all of a sudden.</p>

<p>“‘Do you know what I’m thinking?’ says he.
‘I’m thinking this thing is my mascot, and I’ve been
trying to get rid of my luck all this time. It got me
free of that woman, for we never pulled together
proper, it got me in with you and Slane, and you’ve
made a man of me. Every time I tried to lose it,
bad luck came to me, and look at the luck she’s had
since she lost it, married to that brute of a Burstall.
It’s my luck I’ve been trying to get rid of, and now I
know, I’m going to do big things.’</p>

<p>“I left him at the station, and met him a year later
all broke down and half in rags.</p>

<p>“‘Why, Billy.’ I said, ‘what ails you?’</p>

<p>“‘I lost my mascot,’ says he. ‘I was getting on
fine and making money hand over fist when a damn
landlady pinched it out of my wardrobe, though I
never could bring it home to her. It took all the heart
out of me and things went wrong all round.’</p>

<p>“I gave him a dollar and never saw him again,”
finished Brent, “and I’ve just told you about him
to show you what nerves and fancies and such like
may bring a man to.&mdash;Now as to that dead Chink.”</p>

<p>But I wasn’t bothering any more about the Chink,
maybe because of the fresh air of the harbour, maybe
because of the awful warning contained in the story
of Billy Broke.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XII.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE MAKING OF A MILLIONAIRE</span>
</h2>
<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>I’ve told you, said Brent, that Slane had an
old uncle in San Francisco, Pat O’Brien, worth
over two million dollars they said he was and
I don’t doubt them. Pat had landed in New York
somewhere in the ’fifties or ’sixties without a jitney,
then he’d come along to ’Frisco; he hadn’t struck
gold, he hadn’t struck oil, nor Luck in any special
way as far as we could make out, he’d just become a
millionaire, and one day when we were on the trip
back to ’Frisco with a full cargo, I said to Buck:
“Look here, Buck,” I says, “you and me has been
trading together the last ten years. We’re up to
every game on the Pacific coast, we aren’t simple
sailors no more than a mule is all an ass. Well,
we’ve got sixty thousand dollars between us put by,
but four years ago we had forty thousand. We make
our money hard and earn it slow, seems to me. Look
at Pat, he’s none of our natural advantages; the chap
can’t more than read and write his name, he’s only
one brain and we’ve got two, but look at him, rolling
in dollars. How’s it done?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” says Buck. “It’s the way they all
do it. Seems to me it’s the start. If you’re American-born
you start selling newspapers, if you’re only a
blistered alien you land without a cent in your pocket,
whereas we’d got a few dollars, but there’s no going
back.”</p>

<p>We left it at that and got into ’Frisco next day
and went to the lodgings we had in Tallis Street. We’d
always lived small considering that we could have
cut a bigger dash if we’d chosen, but the fact of the
matter is, living big for the likes of us would have
meant soaking in bars and all the trimmings that
go with that. It’s God’s truth that a plain sailor
man who isn’t what the damn fools who run the world
call a “gentleman” is clean out of it in the big towns&mdash;unless
he’s a millionaire. So, not being able to
sit on the top of the pyramid, we just sat on the sand
waiting for some big strike, and stuck to our rooms in
Tallis Street in a house kept by a Mrs. Murphy.</p>

<p>Well, as I was saying, we went to our lodgings,
and a couple of days after, old Pat O’Brien, hearing
we were back, called on us. Pat, though he was near
eighty, was an early bird, and though he was worth
two millions he always footed it about the town; he
was the spit and image of Mr. Jiggs in the comic papers,
and as we were sitting at breakfast in he came with a
cigar butt stuck in the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>“Lord love me,” says Pat. “Nine o’clock and you
at breakfast. No,” he says, “I won’t have no coffee,
a glass of hot water is all I take till one o’clock in the
day, and then I have a porterhouse-steak and a pint
of claret, and that’s why I have all my teeth though
I’m close on eighty&mdash;and how’s the old Greyhound
been doing this trip?”</p>

<p>I’ve told you before how Buck got the Greyhound
out of Pat at our first go off, and he made it a habit
always to call on us when we were in from a trip to
ask after her. He didn’t care a dump about her, he
just wanted to pick up Island news that might be useful
to him in his business&mdash;but we never pretended we
knew that.</p>

<p>“Doing fine,” says Buck.</p>

<p>Then Pat sits down and borrows a match to light
his cigar stump, and in half an hour he’d got to know
all he wanted; then, when we’d given him a cigar
to get rid of him, off he goes stumping down the stairs,
and a minute after, the window being open owing to
the hot weather, we heard him talking to Micky
Murphy, the landlady’s little boy, who was playing
in the street. Couldn’t hear what he was saying at
first till a bit of a breeze came in and we heard him
say to the child: “So Micky is your name,” he says.
“Well, come along, and bring your play toy with you
and I’ll buy you some candy.”</p>

<p>I stuck my head out of the window, and there was
the old chap and the child hand-in-hand going off
down the street towards the candy shop at the corner.</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “Buck, we’ve misjudged him; he’s
got a heart somewhere and he’s not as mean as he
advertises himself.”</p>

<p>Buck was as much taken aback as myself. You see,
we’d had a lot of dealings with the old man and he’d
always forgot his purse if a tram fare was to be paid,
and I’ve seen him pick up a match in the street to
light his cigar, which he was always letting go out to
save tobacco&mdash;and there he was going off to buy a
child candy.</p>

<p>But that was only the beginning of things, for two
days later we had a note from him asking us to dinner.</p>

<p>He had only asked us to dinner once before, years
ago, and that was when he was shook out of himself
by a deal we’d done over pearls, and it was at a
restaurant. This time he was asking us to his house.</p>

<p>“What’s he after?” says Buck, turning the letter
over. “Day before yesterday he was giving Micky
Murphy candy, and now he’s asking us to dinner.
He’ll bust himself with generosity if he doesn’t mind
out. Will you go?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said I, and we went.</p>

<p>Pat was married, as perhaps I haven’t told you,
and when the darkie let us in, there was Mrs. Pat
waiting to receive us in the big room hung with
pictures opening from the hall, and a minute after in
come Pat’s daughter Sadie with her hair frizzed out,
and when Pat toddled in after, if it wasn’t McMorrows
Jiggs family to the life, call me a nigger.</p>

<p>We didn’t feel comfortable by no means, not being
used to female society done up in diamonds, but
they were anxious to please, though I could see plain
enough that behind everything those two women
looked on us as plated goods, but Pat kept the ball
rolling, chatting away, and at dinner, after the champagne
had gone round, the girl suddenly turns to Buck,
and, “Tell us about your last voyage, Mr. Slane?”
says she.</p>

<p>“Oh,” says Buck, “there’s nothing much to tell;
we went to Levua. We’ve been there three trips;
there’s several German traders we’re in with and they
give us a lot of business. We’re off there again in a
month.”</p>

<p>“Is it a long way?” she questions.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a good bit of a way,” he answers, “and
it would be longer only the <i>Greyhound</i> is no tortoise.”</p>

<p>“How interesting,” she says, “and I suppose you
see plenty of other islands on the way there and back.
Are they as pretty as people say?”</p>

<p>“Well,” says Buck, “as a matter of fact we stop
nowhere but a place we call Palm Island. We put
in there for water and fruit; it’s not on the charts
and there’s no trade to be done there, but it’s pretty
enough.”</p>

<p>He describes the place, and then she tackles him
on Levua again, and the manners of the natives,
and then Mrs. Pat cuts in and talks of the opera and
the theatres and such.</p>

<p>Dinner over, we go to the drawing-room, where
the women squall at the piano for a bit, and then
we go to Pat’s den for cigars.</p>

<p>I remember Buck, who was livened up a bit with
the champagne, asking Pat how to become a millionaire.</p>

<p>“Why,” says Pat, cocking his eye at the other,
“you just pick a million up and stick to it. It’s
not the picking it up that’s the bother, it’s the sticking
to it,” he says. Then we went home thinking that
Pat had been joking with us. But he hadn’t.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>Levenstein was the name of the chief German trader
at Levua. We had big dealings with him amounting
to a share in his business, and we were going out this
time with a cargo of trade goods and with some agricultural
stuff for a man by name of Marks who had
started a plantation on the north of the island. Our
hands were pretty full, for we were our own stevedores,
not trusting the longshore Johnnies over much, and
one day, as we were on deck, the both of us, who should
come along the wharf but Pat. Pat looked down in
the mouth and as if something was troubling him. He
gave us good-day and asked us how we were doing,
and then he told us his bother. Sadie wasn’t well,
the doctors thought she was going into a consumption.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing but trouble in this world,” said
Pat. “First I lost my partner six months ago,
then I lost a cargo which wasn’t full insured by a
mistake of a damn clerk, and now Sadie is took bad.
Well, good-day to you, boys, and better luck than is
attending me.”</p>

<p>“Now I wonder why he came along the wharf to
tell us that,” says Buck. “Blessed if I can make
the old man out. His compasses are wrong, he ain’t
sailing true; he’s doing things he’s never done before.
Maybe he’s breaking up with old age and that’s what’s
the matter with him.”</p>

<p>“He seems to have taken a fancy to us anyhow,”
I says, “and if he’s breaking up let’s hope he won’t
forget you in his will.”</p>

<p>Then we went on with our work, thinking no more
about him till two days later up he turns again, comes
down to the cabin of the <i>Greyhound</i>, pulls out a big
handkerchief, blows his nose and wipes his eyes and
starts his batteries.</p>

<p>“Me child’s going to die,” says he. “Oh, it’s the
cruel disease as has caught hold of her; it’s only
trotting now, but once it begins to gallop Dr. Hennassy
says he won’t give her a fortnight. Nothing will save
her, he says, but a long sea voyage away from excitement
with the good God’s ozone round her. Steamships
is no good, and there’s nothing in ’Frisco but
Cape Horners and timber ships. Buck, you’re me
nephew, and by the same token you had the old <i>Greyhound</i>
out of me for next to nothing, though I’m not
worryin’ about that. Take her for a trip and I’ll pay
the expenses; she can take the old Kanaka mammy
with her, that brought her up, to look after her. If
it’s ten thousand dollars you can have it, but get her
out into God’s good ozone, away off to Honolulu and
away round that way for a six months’ trip; fling your
cargo in the harbour,” he says, “and I’ll pay, for it’s
me house is on fire and me child is burnin’, and what
do I care for money where her life is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Buck, “I’d take her jumping, but
well you know I’m under contract, and as for throwing
the cargo in the harbour, barring what the Port
Authorities would say, it’s not mine to throw.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says the old man, “take her along with
you, cargo and all; you’ve got an after cabin you
don’t use with two bunks in it, that will do for them.
You two bunk here in the main cabin, don’t you?
Well, there you are, and I’ll pay you a thousand dollars
for the trip.”</p>

<p>“Not a cent,” says Buck. “I don’t eat my relations
when they’re in trouble. If I take her she goes
free&mdash;and, sure, how am I to refuse to take her seeing
what you say?”</p>

<p>“That’s me brave boy,” says Pat, “the true son
of me sister Mary, God rest her soul.”</p>

<p>Then when we’d done some more talk he goes off.</p>

<p>“Well,” I says to Buck, “here’s a nice cargo.”</p>

<p>I’ve told you Buck was married to a woman who
had run away from him. He’d never bothered to
get divorced from her, fearing if he got amongst lawyers,
he’d be sure to be robbed, and feeling that, as he
didn’t ever want to get married again, buying a
divorce would be like a chap with no heart for music
buying a concertina.</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, rubbing it into him, “here’s a nice
cargo. I’m no marrying man, and you’re hitched,
so what’s the good of her; a thousand dollars won’t
pay us for freightage, and if there’s a scratch on her
when we get back, there’ll be hell to pay with Pat.
S’pose she dies on us?” I says.</p>

<p>“And what would she die of?” asks he.</p>

<p>“Why, what but consumption?” says I.</p>

<p>Buck laughed.</p>

<p>“Consumption of victuals is all that’s wrong with
her,” he says, and then he says no more, but goes
on deck leaving me harpooned.</p>

<p>I’d taken in this consumption business as honest
coin, and now, by Buck’s manner and words, I saw
that Pat had been lying to us.</p>

<p>The skylight was open, and seeing Buck’s shadow
across it, I called him down and, “For the love of
God,” I says, “don’t tell me that the old man has
been stuffing us. What’s his meaning?”</p>

<p>“It’s a family affair,” says Buck, “and I’d sooner
leave it at that till we get to the end of it, but if you
ask his meaning, why I’ll tell you straight that Pat
has only one meaning in everything he does, and
that’s robbery. He’s making to best me. I can’t
see his game yet or what he is playing for, I can only
say the stake’s big or he wouldn’t be pulling the girl
into it.”</p>

<p>“But where’s the meaning of it?” I says, “unless
he’s sending the girl to queer our pitch with Levenstein,
and that wouldn’t be worth his trouble; there’s not
enough business doing at Levua to make it worth his
while, considering the big deals he’s always after.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says Buck, “I don’t know what’s his game,
but I’m going to find out.”</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>Day before we sailed, down came two trunks and a
hat box, and the next day down came the girl herself
with the old Kanaka mammy and Pat.</p>

<p>He stood on the wharfside and waved to us as we
were tugged out, and Sadie stood and waved back to
him. She had a lot of good points that girl, though
straight dealing wasn’t one of them, and she didn’t
seem to mind, no more than if she was going on a picnic.
She took the tumble at the bar as if she was used to it,
and she settled to the life of the ship same as a man
might have done.</p>

<p>She was always wanting to know things&mdash;names of
the ropes and all such, and she hadn’t been a week
on board before she began to poke her nose into the
navigating and charts. She used to cough sometimes
at first, but after a while she dropped all that, saying
the sea air had taken her cough away.</p>

<p>Now you wouldn’t believe unless you’d been there,
the down we took on that piece before a week had
gone.</p>

<p>It wasn’t anything she said or anything she did,
it was just the way she carried on. She was civil
and she gave no more trouble than another might
have done, but we weren’t her style, and she made
us feel it. Only a woman can make a strong and
straight man feel like a worm. It wasn’t even that
she despised us for being below her class, she didn’t;
she never thought of us, and she made us feel we weren’t
men but just things&mdash;get me?</p>

<p>“Buck,” I says to him one day, “if you could hollow
that piece out, stick her on a pivot and put a lid on
her, she’d make an A 1 freezing machine.”</p>

<p>“She would,” said Buck, “and if you were to plate
her with gold and set her with diamonds, you couldn’t
make a lady out of her.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said I, “but all the same she’ll be an
A 1 navigator before she’s done with us.”</p>

<p>One evening, somewhere north of Palmyra&mdash;we’d
been blown a bit south of our course&mdash;I was on deck.
Buck was below and a Kanaka was at the wheel, and
a moon like a frying pan was rising up and lighting the
deck so’s you could count the dowels. I’d turned to
have a look over the after rail, and when I turned again
there was Buck just come on deck and an hour before
his time.</p>

<p>He came up and took me by the arm and walked me
forward a bit.</p>

<p>“I’ve found it out,” he says.</p>

<p>“What?” I asks.</p>

<p>“Why Pat O’Brien took Mrs. Murphy’s child off to
buy it candy,” he says.</p>

<p>I thought he’d gone off his head for the moment.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking and thinking ever since we left
’Frisco,” he goes on, “thinking and thinking, and there
it was under my nose all the time.”</p>

<p>“What?” I questions.</p>

<p>“The reason of the whole of this business,” says he,
“why Pat O’Brien, the brother of my mother Mary&mdash;God
rest her soul&mdash;parted with five cents to buy a kid
candy, why he asked us to dinner, why he pretended
that freezing mixture down below had consumption,
why he shipped her on board the <i>Greyhound</i>, and what
it is she’s after. It’s all as plain as day, and there’s
more to it than that. Brent, we’re millionaires.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” I says, “like a good chap, will you
take your mind off the business and pull yourself
together&mdash;you’ve been thinking too much over this
business; forget it.”</p>

<p>Buck was a queer devil. You never knew how he’d
take things. Seeing I thought his head had gone wrong,
instead of explaining like a sensible chap, he cut the
thing off short.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right,” he says. “Maybe I’m
crazy, maybe I’m not. I’ll say nothing more. We’ll
see.”</p>

<p>I left it at that, not wanting to stir up trouble in
his head, and we didn’t talk of the thing again&mdash;not
for a long time, anyhow.</p>

<p>But a change had come over Buck. He’d got to
be as cheerful as a cricket, and I’d see him sometimes
at table sitting staring in front of himself as if he
was looking at the New Jerusalem, instead of the
bird’s-eye panelling of the after bulkhead; then, by
his talk I could tell his head was travelling on the
same old track; when a man talks of the building
price of steam yachts you can tell how his mind is
running, same as when he talks of rents on Pacific
Avenue and such places. But I said nothing, just
kept my head shut and let him talk, and glad I was
the morning we raised Levua.</p>

<p>It’s a big island&mdash;if you’ve never been down that
way&mdash;mountainous and with no proper reef only
to the west, for east the sea comes smack up to the
cliffs&mdash;but it’s pretty, what with the trees and all,
and there’s a big waterfall comes down on the south
from the hills that’s reckoned one of the sights of the
island.</p>

<p>Levenstein’s house was on the beach to the west;
a run of reef, broken here and there, kept the sea pretty
smooth on the beach, and there was ten fathoms
close up to the sand. A lot of scouring goes on there
with the tides, and the fishings the best I’ve seen anywhere,
just in that bit of water.</p>

<p>Old Pat O’Brien hadn’t asked to see a photograph
of Levenstein, else maybe he wouldn’t have been so
keen on shipping Sadie off on her travels; I’d forgot
the fellow’s good looks, but when he boarded us after
we’d dropped the hook, I remembered the fact and
I saw he’d taken Sadie’s eye.</p>

<p>Levenstein wasn’t unlike Kaiser Bill, only younger
and better-looking; he was the sort women like, and
he could coo like a damn turtle dove when he was in
the mind, but he had the reputation of having whipped
a Kanaka to death. I’d just as soon have given a
girl’s happiness to that chap as I’d have given a rump
steak to a tiger cat trustin’ in it to honour it. No, sir,
that build don’t make for happiness, not much, and
if Sadie had been my girl when I saw her setting her
eyes on him like that, I’d have put the <i>Greyhound</i>
to sea again, even if I’d had to shove her over the reef
to get out.</p>

<p>But I wasn’t bothering about Sadie’s happiness; I
reckoned a little unhappiness mightn’t help to do her
much harm by unsticking her glue a bit, and I reckon
Buck felt the same, so, having business in the trade
room and ashore enough to last us for days, we let
things rip and didn’t bother.</p>

<p>Sadie and the old Mammy were given the overseer’s
house on shore, and the girl settled down to enjoy
herself. She was awfully keen on exploring the island
and seeing the natives, and she and the old Kanaka
woman would make excursions, taking their grub with
them, and having picnics all over the place, and
Levenstein would go with her sometimes, and Marks,
from the north of the island, would come over sometimes,
and it made my blood fair boil to see her carrying
on with those two Germans because she thought
them gentlemen, and at the same time cold-shouldering
us as if we weren’t more than the dirt she walked
on.</p>

<p>I said the same to Buck, and Buck he only says:
“Leave her to me,” he says, “she’s come out to get
what she won’t get, but she’ll get what she little expects
if she marries uncle Lev,” says Buck. “Leave her to
me,” he says, “I’ll l’arn her before I’ve done with
her,” he says. “Damn her!” says he&mdash;which wasn’t
the language to use about a girl, but then Sadie wasn’t
so much a girl as a china figure all prickles, no use to
hold or carry and not the ornament you’d care to stick
on your chimney-piece if you wanted to be happy in
your home.</p>

<p>One day Buck says to me: “Come on over to the
north of the island,” he says, “I want to have a
talk to Marks.”</p>

<p>“What about?” I asks.</p>

<p>“The beauty of the scenery,” he replies.</p>

<p>Off we started. Germans are some good, they can
make roads&mdash;if I haven’t told you Levua was a German
island, I’ll tell you now. I’m saying Germans can
make roads, and if you doubt me, go and see the
twelve-mile coral road they’ve made round Nauru
or what they’ve done in German New Guinea, and the
road to Marks’ plantation was as good as those.</p>

<p>Coming along for late afternoon we hit the place, and
found Marks in. Marks was like one of those Dutchmen
you see in the comic papers, long china pipe and
all, but he was the most level-headed man in the
Islands, and I soon found that Buck had come to him
for information and not to talk about the beauty of
the scenery.</p>

<p>We had drinks and cigars, and presently Buck says
to Marks, “Look here,” he says, “you’re a man that
knows everything about the West Pacific, s’pose I
found an island that wasn’t on the charts and didn’t
belong to anybody, which of the blessed nations would
make a claim to it; would it be the one whose territory
was closest to it?”</p>

<p>Marks leans back in his chair and lights his pipe again,
then he says: “If you find an unknown island, it
would belong to England or Germany, all depends on
where it lies in the West Pacific.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” says Buck. “Why wouldn’t the
French or Dutch have a look in?”</p>

<p>“It’s this way,” says Marks, “Germany in old
days wasn’t a sea-going nation much, and so the English
and French and Dutch took up nearly all the
islands of the Pacific, leaving Germany in the cold
till 1865, when she began to want things and show
that she could get them. She took a big bite of New
Guinea, then she came to an arrangement with England
that she and England would take all the lands and
islands in the West Pacific no one else had seized and
divide them between them. Get me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Buck.</p>

<p>“The line starts from New Guinea,” says Marks,
“then goes east, then north to fifteen degrees north
latitude, and 173 degrees, 30 seconds east longitude;
anything new found west of that would be German,
anything to the east, British.”</p>

<p>“Show us the line on a map,” says Buck, and
Marks gets up and fetches down a map and draws
the line with a pencil.</p>

<p>Buck gives a great sigh and thanks him, and then
we started off back home with the rising moon to show
us our way and a three hours’ tramp before us.</p>

<p>On the way I tried to get out of him what his
meaning was in asking those questions, but he wouldn’t
tell.</p>

<p>“You thought I was mad when I tried to tell you
first,” he said, “and now you’ll have to wait till I’ve
landed the business, but I’ll tell you one thing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?” I asks.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he says, “shut heads are best where
a word might spoil everything.”</p>

<div class='secn'>IV</div>

<p>Three weeks at Levua got the cargo out and the
cargo in, and the morning came when we were due
to start. Sadie and Levenstein had been getting
thicker and thicker; she was one of those girls that
take the bit between the teeth, and it didn’t knock
us down with surprise when, coming on board with
her trunks, she said she’d been married that morning
to Mr. Levenstein by the native parson and that
Levenstein was going to follow her on to ’Frisco by
the next boat he could catch.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of such a tomfool arrangement?
For she could just as well have waited till he got to
’Frisco, and then she’d have had time to change her
mind; that’s what Buck told her as we put out with
Levenstein waving to us from the shore.</p>

<p>Buck rubbed it into her proper, he being a relative
and all that, but I doubt if he wasn’t as glad as myself
to think of the face Pat would pull when he found his
daughter had married herself to a small island trader
and a German at that. She took his lip without saying
a word, and a day or two after she made inquiries as
to when we should reach Palm Island.</p>

<p>“Oh, in a day or two,” says Buck.</p>

<p>Now we weren’t due to touch at that place for fourteen
days if the wind held good, and when I got him
alone a few minutes later I asked him why he had told
her that lie.</p>

<p>“And what would you have had me say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, that we wouldn’t be there for a fortnight,”
I answered.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “that would have been as big a
lie, for we aren’t going to touch there at all. I’ve got
extra water casks from that cooper chap at Levua
and an extra supply of bananas.”</p>

<p>“What’s your reason?” I asks.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when this deal is through,” he answers,
and knowing it was useless to ask any more, I didn’t.</p>

<p>A few days later. Buck told us that we’d passed
the location of the island and that it wasn’t there;
must have sunk in the sea, he said, same as these small
islands sometimes do.</p>

<p>When he sprung this on us you might have thought
by the way Sadie went on she’d lost a relative; said
that she wanted to see it more than the New Jerusalem,
owing to Buck’s description of it, and asked
couldn’t we poke round and make sure it was gone
and that we weren’t being deceived owing to some
error of the compass.</p>

<p>Buck says: “All right,” and we spent the better
part of two days fooling about pretending to look for
that damn island and then we lit for ’Frisco.</p>

<p>No sooner had we got there and landed the cargo,
Sadie included, than Buck says to me one morning:
“Clutch on here,” he says, “whilst I’m away. I’m
going to London.”</p>

<p>“London, Ontario?” I asks.</p>

<p>“No, London, England,” he says.</p>

<p>“And what are you going there for?” I questions.</p>

<p>“To see the Tower,” says he.</p>

<p>Off he goes and in two months he returns.</p>

<div class='secn'>V</div>

<p>I was sitting at breakfast when he comes in, having
arrived by the early morning train.</p>

<p>Down he sits and has a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>“How’s Pat?” says he.</p>

<p>“You’re even with Pat,” I says. “Levenstein got
here a week ago and Pat don’t like his new son-in-law.
There’s been the devil to pay.”</p>

<p>“I’m better even with him than that,” says Buck.
“Brent, we’re millionaires.”</p>

<p>“Spit yer meaning out,” I says.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” says he, “my saying to you
last time we touched at Palm Island that the place
seemed built of a sort of rock I’d never seen before,
and my bringing a chunk of it away in my pocket?
Well, what do you think that rock is but phosphate of
lime.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” I queries.</p>

<p>“Seagull guano mixed with the lime of coral,” he
says, “the finest fertiliser in the world and worth
thirteen to fourteen dollars a ton. How many tons
would Palm Island weigh, do you think, and it’s most
all phosphate of lime?”</p>

<p>I begins to sweat in the palms of my hands, but I
says nothing and he goes on:</p>

<p>“Palm Island being a British possession, since an
Irishman has discovered it and it lies to eastward of
the German British line, I went to London, and I’ve
got not only the fishing rights but the mining rights for
ninety-nine years. I didn’t say nothing about the
mining rights, said I wanted to start a cannery there
since the fishing was so good, and an old cockatoo in
white whiskers did the rest and dropped the mining
rights in gratis like an extra strawberry. Then,
coming through N’ York I got a syndicate together
that’ll buy the proposition when they’ve inspected it.
I’ll take a million or nothing,” says he.</p>

<p>“But, look here,” I says, “how in the nation did
it all happen; how did you know?”</p>

<p>“Well,” says he, “it was this way. That chunk
of rock I was telling you of, I stuck in my sea chest,
and unpacking when I got back I gave it to little Micky
Murphy who was in the room pretending to help me.
He used it for a play toy.</p>

<p>“Now do you remember Pat O’Brien that morning
he left us, talking to Micky outside and taking him off
to buy candy? Well, next day Mrs. Murphy said to
me that the old gentleman was very free with his
money, but she didn’t think he was quite right as he’d
offered Micky a dollar for the stone he was playing
with. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but
later on, you remember that night on board ship, the
thing hit me like a belt on the head.</p>

<p>“Micky had told the old chap I’d given him the
stone when I came back from that trip and Pat had
recognised it for what it was. The only question that
bothered him was where I’d picked it up. He knew
I traded regular with Levua, and when he found we
stopped nowhere but Levua and Palm Island he knew
it was at one of those two places. Phosphate of lime
was to be found, enough maybe to double his fortune.
He sent the girl to prospect, and she’d have done me
in only that night I suddenly remembered a chap
telling me about the phosphate business and saying the
stuff was like rock, striped in places; I’d never thought
of it till then, and what made me think of it was that
I’d been worrying a lot since I’d left ’Frisco over Pat
and all his doings. Seems to me the mind does a lot
of thinking we don’t know of.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I says, “when he sent the girl to prospect
he didn’t bargain she was going to prospect Levenstein.”</p>

<p>“No,” says Buck, “seems to me we’ve got the
double bulge on him.”</p>

<p>But we hadn’t.</p>

<p>Buck got a million for his phosphate rights and gave
me a share, and, as much will have more, we flew high
and lost every buck in the Eagle Consolidated Gold
and Silver Mining Corporation, Inc.</p>

<p>Pat met us the day after the burst and we asked
him how the Levensteins were doing.</p>

<p>“Fine,” says he. “He asked me how to become a
millionaire last night and I told him it was quite easy,
you only had to pick up a million and stick to it,
but mind you,” I said, “it’s not the picking it up’s
the bother, but the sticking to it. Now look at that
Eagle Consolidated business,” I says, “many’s the
fine boy has put his money in tripe stock like that,
tumbling balmy after working for years like a sensible
man. You know the stock I mean,” he finishes.
“The Eagle Consolidated Gold and Silver Mining
Corporation, Inc.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” says Buck.</p>

<p>We didn’t want to have no last words or let the old
boy rub it in any more; we hiked off, Buck and me,
resuming our way to the wharf and the same old life
we’d always been living but for the three months we’d
been million dollar men.</p>

<p>“Pat seemed to have the joke on us,” said Brent,
“but looking back on those three months and the
worries and dyspepsias and late hours that make a
millionaire’s life, I’m not so sure we hadn’t the bulge
on him over the whole transaction, specially considering
that Levenstein went bust, forged cheques and
let him in for forty thousand or so to save the name
of the family.</p>

<p>“That’s the last transaction we ever had with Pat,”
finished Brent. “He dropped calling on us to tell us
how to become millionaires, seeing we’d given instructions
to Mrs. Murphy always to tell him we were out.”</p>

<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>The longest answer to a short question I ever
heard given was delivered by Captain Tom
Bowlby, master mariner, in the back parlour of Jack
Rounds’ saloon away back in 1903.</p>

<p>Bowlby still lingers as a memory in Island bars;
a large mahogany-coloured man, Bristol born and
owned by the Pacific; he had seen sandalwood wane
and copra wax, had known Bully Hayes and the
ruffian Pease and Colonel Steinberger; and as to the
ocean of his fancy, there was scarcely a sounding
from the Kermadecs to French Frigate Island he
could not have given you.</p>

<p>An illiterate man, maybe, as far as book reading
goes, but a full man by reason of experience and
knowledge of Life&mdash;which is Literature in the raw.</p>

<p>“And so, usin’ a figure of speech, she’d stuck the
blister on the wrong chap,” said the Captain finishing
a statement.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Cap’,” came a voice through
the blue haze of tobacco smoke, “but what was you
meanin’ by a figure of speech?”</p>

<p>The Cap’, re-loading his pipe, allowed his eyes to
travel from the window and its view of the blue bay
and the Chinese shrimp boats to the island headdresses
and paddles on the wall and from thence to
the speaker.</p>

<p>“What was I meanin’ by a figure of speech?&mdash;why,
where was you born?” He snorted, lit up, and
accepted another drink and seemed to pass the question
by, but I saw his trouble. He couldn’t explain,
couldn’t give a clear definition off-hand of the term
whose meaning he knew quite well. Can you?</p>

<p>“Well, I was just asking to know,” said the voice.</p>

<p>Then, like a strong man armed, his vast experience
of men and matters came to the aid of Captain
Tom:</p>

<p>“And know you shall,” said he, “if it’s in my
power to put you wise. When you gets travelling
about in Languige you bumps across big facts. You
wouldn’t think words was any use except to talk
them, would you? You wouldn’t think you could
belt a chap over the head with a couple of words
strung together same as with a slung shot, would
you? Well, you can. You was askin’ me what a
figure of speech is&mdash;well, it’s a thing that can kill
a man sure as a shot gun, and Jack Bone, a friend
of mine, seen it done.</p>

<p>“Ever heard of Logan? He’d be before your time,
but he’s well remembered yet down Rapa way, a tall,
soft-spoken chap, never drank, blue-eyed chap as
gentle as a woman and your own brother till he’d
skinned you and tanned your hide and sold it for
sixpence. He had offices in Sydney to start with
and three or four schooners in the trade, <i>bêche de mer</i>,
turtle shell and copra, with side interests in drinkin’
bars and such, till all of a sudden he went bust and had
to skip, leaving his partner to blow his brains out,
and a wife he wasn’t married to with six children
to fend for. What bust him? Lord only knows;
it wasn’t his love of straight dealin’ anyhow. Then
he came right down on the beach, with his toes through
his boots, till he managed to pick a living somehow
at Vavao and chummed in with a trader by name of
Cartwright, who’d chucked everything owing to a
woman and taken to the Islands and a native wife&mdash;one
of them soft-shelled chaps that can’t stand
Luck, nohow, unless it’s with them. Logan got to
be sort of partner with Cartwright, who died six
months after, and they said Logan had poisoned him
to scoop the business. Some said it was the native
wife who did the killing, being in love with Logan,
who took her on with the goodwill and fixtures. If
she did, she got her gruel, for he sold out to a German
after he’d been there less than a year, and skipped
again. I reckon that chap must have been born with
a skippin’ rope in his fist by the way he went through
life. They say wickedness don’t prosper; well, in
my experience it prospers well enough up to a point;
anyhow Logan after he left Vavao didn’t do bad,
by all accounts; he struck here and there, pearling
in the Paumotus and what not, and laying by money
all the time, got half shares in a schooner and bought
the other chap out, took her blackbirding in the
Solomons, did a bit of opium smuggling, salved a
derelict and brought her right into ’Frisco, turned
the coin into real estate at San Lorenz, and sold out
for double six months after; then he went partners
with a chap called Buck Johnstone in a saloon by the
water side close on to Rafferty’s landin’ stage, a regular
Shanghai and dope shop with ward politics thrown in,
and a place in the wrecking ring, and him going about
’Frisco with a half-dollar Henry Clay in his face and
a diamond as big as a decanter stopper for a scarf pin.</p>

<p>“He didn’t drink, as I was saying, and that gave
him the bulge on the others. He had a bottle of his
own behind the bar with coloured water in it, and when
asked to have a drink he’d fill up out of it, leaving
the others to poison themselves with whisky.</p>

<p>“Then one night James Appleby blew into the bar.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>“Appleby was a chap with a fresh red face on him,
a Britisher, hailing from Devonshire and just in from
the Islands. He’d been supercargo on a schooner
trading in the Marshalls or somewhere that’d got piled
on a reef by a drunken skipper and sea battered till
there wasn’t a stick of her standing and everyone
drowned but Appleby and the Kanaka bo’sun. He
was keen to tell of his troubles and had a thirst on him,
and there he stood lowering the bilge Johnstone passed
over to him and trying to interest strangers in his
family history and sea doings. Logan was behind
the bar with Johnstone, and Logan, listening to the
chap clacking with a half-drunk bummer, suddenly
pricks his ears. Then he comes round to the front
of the bar and listens to his story, and takes him by
the arm and walks him out of the place on to the
wharf and sits him on a bollard, Appleby clacking
away all the time and so full of himself and his story,
and so glad to have a chap listening to him, and so
mixed up with the whisky that he scarce noticed that
he’d left the bar.</p>

<p>“Then, when he’d finished, he seen where he was, and
was going back for more drinks, but Logan stopped him.</p>

<p>“‘One moment,’ says Logan, ‘what was that you
were saying about pearls to that chap I heard you
talking to. Talking about a pearl island, you were,
and him sucking it in; don’t you know better than
to give shows like that away in bars to promiscuous
strangers?’</p>

<p>“‘I didn’t give him the location,’ hiccups the other
chap, ‘and I don’t remember mentioning pearls in
particular, but they’re there sure enough and gold-tipped
shell; say, I’m thirsty, let’s get back for more
drinks.’</p>

<p>“Now that chap hadn’t said a word about pearls,
but he’d let out in his talk to the bummer that down
in the Southern Pacific they’d struck an island not
on the charts, and he had the location in his head
and wasn’t going to forget it, and more talk like that,
till Logan, sober and listening, made sure in his mind
that the guy had struck phosphates or pearls, and
played his cards according.</p>

<p>“‘One moment,’ says Logan. ‘You’ve landed
fresh with that news in your head and you’re in ’Frisco,
lettin’ it out in the first bar you drop into&mdash;ain’t
you got more sense?’</p>

<p>“‘It’s not in my head,’ says the other, ‘it’s in my
pocket.’</p>

<p>“‘What are you getting at?’ says Logan.</p>

<p>“‘It’s wrote down,’ says Appleby. ‘Latitude
and longitude on my notebook, and the book’s in
my pocket. Ain’t you got no understanding?
Keeping me here talking till I’m dry as an old boot.
Come along back to the bar.’</p>

<p>“Back they went, and Logan calls for two highballs,
giving Johnstone the wink, and he takes Appleby
into the back parlour and Johnstone served them the
highballs with a cough drop in Appleby’s, and two
minutes after that guy was blind as Pharaoh on his
back on the old couch&mdash;doped.</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>“There was a stairs leading down from that parlour
to a landing stage, and when they’d stripped the guy
of his pocket-book and loose money, they gave him a
row off to a whaler that was due out with the morning
tide and got ten dollars for the carcase. Jack Bone
was the boatman they always used, and it was Jack
Bone told most of the story I’m telling you now.</p>

<p>“Then they comes back and closes up the bar,
and sits down to investigate the notebook, and there,
sure enough, was the indications, the latitude and
longitude, with notes such as ‘big bed to west of the
break in the reef,’ and so on.</p>

<p>“‘That does it,’ says Johnstone; ‘we’re made men,
sure; this beats ward politics by a mile and a half,’
says he. ‘It’s only a question of a schooner and
hands to work her and diving dresses; we don’t want
no labour; see here what the blighter says, “native
labour sufficient.” Lord love me! what a swab,
writing all that down; hadn’t he no memory to carry
it in?’</p>

<p>“He’d struck the truth. There’s some chaps never
easy unless they’re putting things on paper. I’ve
seen chaps keeping diaries, sort of logs, and putting
down every time they’d scratched their heads or
sneezed, blame fools same as Appleby.</p>

<p>“Well, Logan sits thinking things over, and says
he: ‘We’re both in this thing, though it’s my find.
Still I’m not grumbling. What’s the shares to be?’</p>

<p>“‘Half shares,’ says Johnstone, prompt. Logan
does another think:</p>

<p>“‘Right,’ says he, ‘and we each pays our shot
in the fitting out of the expedition.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m agreeable,’ says the other, with a grin on
his face, which maybe wouldn’t have been there if
he’d known what was going on in Logan’s mind.</p>

<p>“Next morning they starts to work to look for a
likely schooner; Johnstone keeping the bar and
Logan doing the prospecting. It wasn’t an easy job,
for they had to keep things secret. They knew
enough of the Law to be afraid of it, and though this
island of Appleby’s was uncharted, they weren’t
going to lay no claims to it with the Britishers popping
up, maybe, or the French or the Yanks with priority
claims, and every dam liar from Vancouver to Panama
swearing he’d done the discovering of it first. No,
their plan was to sneak out and grab what they could,
working double shifts and skimming the hull lagoon
in one big coop that’d take them maybe a year. Then
when they’d got their pearls and stored their shell,
they reckoned to bring the pearls back to ’Frisco,
where Johnstone had the McGaffery syndicate behind
him, who’d help him to dispose of them, and after that
he reckoned if things went well, to go back and fetch
the shell. Pearl shell runs from three hundred to a
thousand dollars a ton depending on quality, and gold-tipped
being second quality the stuff would be worth
carting.</p>

<p>“Well, Logan had luck and he managed to buy
Pat Ginnell’s old schooner, the <i>Heart of Ireland</i>, for
two thousand dollars, Pat having struck it rich in
the fruit business and disposing of his sea interests;
they paid twelve hundred dollars for diving gear
and a thousand for trade goods to pay the workers,
stick tobacco and all such; then they had to provision
her, reckoning the island would give them all
the fish and island truck they’d want, and, to cap
the business, they had to get a crew that wouldn’t
talk, Kanakas or Chinks&mdash;they shipped Chinks.
Logan knew enough navigating to take her there,
and Johnstone was used to the sea, so they were
their own afterguard.</p>

<p>“Then one day, when all was ready, Johnstone
sold out his interest in the saloon, and the next day,
or maybe the day after, out they put.</p>

<div class='secn'>IV</div>

<p>“I’d forgot to say they took Bone with them.
They’d used the chap so much in the outfitting that
they thought it was better to take him along than
leave him behind to talk, maybe; and they’d no
sooner cleared the Gate and left the Farallones behind
them than the weather set up its fist against them,
and the old <i>Heart</i> with a beam sea showed them
how she could roll; she could beat a barrel any
day in the week on that game; it was an old saying
on the front that she could beat Ginnell when he
was drunk, and Bone said the rolling took it out
of them so that it was a sick and quarrelling ship
right from the start to the line. All but Logan. He
never quarrelled with no one, he wasn’t that sort;
always smooth spoken and give and take, he held
that show together, smilin’ all the time.</p>

<p>“Then ten degrees south of the line and somewhere
between the Paumotus and Bolivia they
began to keep their eyes skinned for the island,
struck the spot given by Appleby and went right
over it.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t no island.</p>

<p>“About noon it was on the day they ought to
have hit the place, an’ you can picture that flummoxed
lot standin’ on the deck of the old <i>Heart;</i> thousands
of dollars gone on a schooner and trade and all, and
then left.</p>

<p>“The sails were drawing and they were still heading
south, and Johnstone up and spoke:</p>

<p>“‘Appleby’s done us,’ says he, ‘and there’s no
use in crying over spilt milk. There’s nothing for it
but to go back and sell off at a loss. I’m done
worse than you, seein’ I’ve sold the saloon. Tell
you what, I’ll give you fifteen hundred dollars for
your share in the ship and fixin’s; maybe I’ll lose
when I come to realise,’ says he, ‘for there’s no knowing
what she and the truck will fetch when it comes
to auction.’</p>

<p>“He was one of them lightning calculators, and
he reckoned to clear a few hundred dollars on the
deal.</p>

<p>“Logan was likewise, and he thinks for a moment,
and he says, ‘Make it sixteen hundred and I’ll sell
you my share in the dam show right out.’</p>

<p>“Done,” says Johnstone.</p>

<p>“The words were scarce out of his mouth when
the Chink stuck in the crosstree cries out ‘Ki, hi.’</p>

<p>“The whole bundle of them was in the rigging
next minute lookin’ ahead, and then, right to s’uth’ard,
there was a white stain on the sky no bigger than
a window.</p>

<p>“Logan laughs.</p>

<p>“‘That’s her,’ says he.</p>

<p>“Then they see the pa’m tops like heads of pins,
and they came down.</p>

<p>“If that was the island, then Appleby’s position
was near fifty miles out, and again, if it was the
island, Logan was done, seeing he’d sold his interest
in the show to Johnstone. Bone said he didn’t
turn a hair, just laughed like the good-natured chap
he was, whiles they cracked everything on and raised
the place, coming into the lagoon near sundown.</p>

<p>“But Bone had begun to have his suspicions of
Logan by the way he took the business, and determined
to keep his weather eye lifting.</p>

<p>“It was a big atoll, near a mile broad at its
narrowest and running north and south, with the
reef break to north just as given in Appleby’s notebook.
They ran her to the west a bit when they
got in, and dropped anchor near the beach, where
there was a Kanaka village with canoe houses and
all, and the Kanakas watching them. They didn’t
bother about no Kanakas; it was out boat as soon
as the killick had took the coral, and hunt for oysters.
And there they were, sure enough, a bit more up by
the western beach as Appleby had noted in his book,
square acres of them, virgin oysters if ever oysters
were virgins, and a dead sure fortune.</p>

<p>“The chaps came back and went down below
to have a clack, and Johnstone turns generous, which
he couldn’t well help, seeing that Logan might turn
on him and blow the gaff, and says he: ‘You’ve
stood out and sold your share in the venture, but
I’m no shyster, and, if you’re willing, you shall have
quarter share in the takings and half a share in the
shell.’</p>

<p>“‘Right,’ says Logan.</p>

<p>“‘You helping to work the beds,’ said Johnstone.</p>

<p>“‘I’m with you,’ says the other.</p>

<p>“Old Jack Bone, who was listening, cocked his
ear at this.</p>

<p>“It seemed to him more than ever that Logan
was too much of a Christian angel over the hull of
this business. He knew the chap by instinc’ to be
a dam thief, or maybe worse, but he said nothing,
and then a noise brought them up on deck, and they
found the island Kanakas had all put off in canoes
with fruit and live chickens and was wanting to trade.</p>

<p>“It was just after sundown, but that didn’t
matter to them; they lit up torches and the place
was like a regatta round the old <i>Heart</i>.</p>

<p>“Two of the chiefs came aboard and brought their
goods with them and squatted on their hams, Johnstone
doing the bargaining, and, when the bazaar
was over, Johnstone turns to Logan, and says he:
‘Lord love me,’ says he, ‘where did these chaps
learn their business instinc’s? Chicago I shud think.
Where in the nation will we be when it comes to
paying them for the diving work? They’ll clear us
out of goods before a month is over, and that knocks
the bottom out of the proposition. It’s the Labour
problem over again,’ says he, ‘and we’re up against
it.’</p>

<p>“‘We are,’ says Logan, ‘sure. These chaps
aren’t Kanakas; they’re Rockfellers, virgin ones,
maybe, but just as hard shelled. I’ll have to do a
think.’</p>

<p>“The Chinks had all congregated down into the
fo’c’sle to smoke their opium pipes, and Logan, he
lit a cigar and sat down on deck in the light of the
moon that had just risen up, and there he sits like an
image smoking and thinking whiles the others went
below.</p>

<p>“It was a tough proposition.</p>

<p>“The Chinks were no use for diving. They’d
been questioned on that subject and risen against it
to a man. The island Kanakas were the only labour,
and, taking the rate of exchange, the pearls would
have had to be as big as turnips to make the game
pay.</p>

<p>“But this scamp Logan wasn’t the chap to be
bested by Kanakas, and having done his think, he
went below and turned in.</p>

<div class='secn'>V</div>

<p>“Next morning bright and early he tells Johnstone
to get the diving boat out, and he sends Bone ashore
in the dinghy with word for the natives to come out
and see the fun. Bone could talk their lingo. He’d
been potting about forty years in these seas, before
he’d taken up the Shanghai job in ’Frisco, and he
could talk most all the Island patter. Off he goes,
and then the Chinks get the diving boat out, pump
and all, and two sets of dresses, and they rowed her
off and anchored her convenient to the bed, and
they hadn’t more’n got the anchor down when the
canoes came out, and Logan, talking to the Kanakas
by means of Bone, told them he was going down to
walk about on the lagoon floor, dry.</p>

<p>“Then he gets into a dress and has the headpiece
screwed on, and down he goes, the Kanakas all
hanging their heads over the canoe sides and watching
him. They see him walking about and picking
up oysters and making a grab at a passing fish’s
tail and cutting all sorts of antics, and there he stuck
twenty minutes, and they laughing and shouting,
till the place sounded more like Coney Island than a
lonesome lagoon, God knows where, south of the
line.</p>

<p>“Then up he comes, having sent up half a dozen
bags full of oysters, and steps out of his diving gear&mdash;dry.</p>

<p>“They felt him, to make sure he was dry, and then
the row began.</p>

<p>“The chief of the crowd, Maurini by name, wanted
to go down and play about, but Logan held off, asked
him what he’d give to be let down, and the chap
offered half a dozen fowl. Logan closed, and the
chap was rigged up and got his instructions from
Bone of what he was to do, and how he wasn’t to
let the air pipe be tangled, and so on, and how he
was to pick up oysters and send them up in the bag
nets. Down the chap goes, and gets the hang of the
business in two minutes, after he’d done a trip up
or two and nearly strangled himself. After that the
whole of the other chaps were wild to have a hand
in the business, and Logan let them, asking no payment,
only the oysters.</p>

<p>“In a week’s time he had all the labour he wanted.
Those Kanakas were always ready for the fun, and
when any of them tired off there was always green
hands to take their places; the work was nothing
to them; it was something new, and it never lost
colour, not for six months. Then the pumps began
to suck and they’d had enough. Wouldn’t go down
unless under pay, and didn’t do the work half as
well.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, Logan and Johnstone had built a
house ashore and hived half a hat full of pearls, and
about this time the feeling came on Bone strong
that Logan was going to jump. He didn’t know
how, but he was sure in his mind that Logan was
going to do Johnstone in for his share, seeing the
amount of stuff they’d collected.</p>

<p>“He got Johnstone aside and warned him.</p>

<p>“‘You look out,’ says he, ‘never you be alone
with that chap when no one’s looking, for it’s in
my mind he’s going to scrag you.’</p>

<p>“Johnstone laughed.</p>

<p>“‘There ain’t no harm in Logan,’ says he, ‘there’s
not the kick of a flea in him; you mind your business,’
says he, ‘and I’ll tend to mine. Whach you want
putting suspicions in chaps’ heads for?’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ve said what I’ve said,’ says Bone,
‘and I’m not going to say no more.’</p>

<p>“Then he goes off.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, those island bucks had got to fitting
things together in their minds, and they’d got to
connecting pearls with sticks of tobacco and trade
goods, and they’d got to recognise Johnstone as boss
and owner of the pearls and goods. They’d named
Johnstone ‘the fat one’ and they’d labelled Logan
‘the one with teeth,’ and the specifications fitted,
for Johnstone weighed all two hundred and fifty,
and Logan was a dentist’s sign when the grin was
on his face, which was frequent.</p>

<p>“And so things goes on, the Kanakas diving and
bringing up shell and the trade goods sinking till
soon there was scarcely none left to pay the divers,
and level with that was the fac’ that they’d collared
enough pearls to satisfy reasonable chaps.</p>

<p>“One day Bone comes back from the diving and
there wasn’t any Johnstone.</p>

<div class='secn'>VI</div>

<p>“He wasn’t in the house nor anywhere in sight,
and Logan was sitting mending a bag net by the
door.</p>

<p>“‘Where’s Johnstone?’ says Bone.</p>

<p>“‘How the &mdash;&mdash; do I know?’ says Logan. He was
a most civil spoken chap as a rule, and as soon as he’d
let that out of his head, Bone didn’t look round no
more for Johnstone.</p>

<p>“He sat down and smoked a pipe, and fell to
wondering when his turn would come. He had one
thing fixed in his head, and that was the fact that
if he let on to be suspicious old smiler would do him
in. He’d be wanted to help work the schooner back
to ’Frisco, and it was quite on the cards if he pretended
to know nothing and suspec’ nothing he might
get off with his life, but he was in a stew. My hat!
that chap was in a stew. Living with a man-eating
tiger at his elbow wouldn’t be worse, and that night,
when no Johnstone turned up, he could no more
sleep than a runnin’ dynamo driven by a ten thousand
horse-power injin stoked by Satan.</p>

<p>“Logan said a wave must have taken Johnstone
off the outer beach of the reef, or he’d tumbled in and
a shark had took him, and Bone agreed.</p>

<p>“Next day, however, when Bone was taking a
walk away to the north of the house, he saw a lot
of big seagulls among the mammee apple bushes
that grew thick just there, and making his way through
the thick stuff and driving off the birds, he found
old man Johnstone on his face with his head bashed in
and etceteras.</p>

<p>“Bone was a man, notwithstandin’ the fact that
he’d helped to Shanghai poor sailor chaps, and when
he seen Logan’s work he forgot his fright of Logan,
and swore he’d be even with him.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t no law on that island, nor anyone
to help him to hang old toothy; so he fixed it in
his mind to do him in, get him by himself and
bash him on the head same as he’d bashed Johnstone.</p>

<p>“But Logan never gave him a chance, and the
work went on till all the trade goods were used up
and there was no more to pay for the divers.</p>

<p>“‘That’s the end,’ said Logan to Bone, ‘but
it doesn’t matter; we’ve pretty well skinned the
lagoon, and we’ll push out day after to-morrow when
we get water and fruit aboard.’</p>

<p>“‘Where for?’ says Bone.</p>

<p>“‘Sydney,’ says the other; ‘I’m not going back
to ’Frisco, and seeing Johnstone is drowned, the
show is mine; he’s got no relatives. We’ll make
for Sydney, and to make you keep your head shut,
I’ll give you the old schooner for keeps; she’ll fetch
you a good price in Sydney, more than you’d make
in ten dozen years long-shoring in ’Frisco. I only
want the pearls.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ says Bone, ‘I’ll keep my head shut
and help you work her,’ having in his mind to tell
the whole story soon as he landed, for he’d given
up the notion of killing the other chap, not being
able to get him alone. But they never put out for
Sydney, and here’s the reason why.</p>

<p>“There was a Kanaka on that island by name of
Kiliwakee, a chap with a head all frizzled out like
a furze bush. He was a looney, though a good
enough workman, and he’d got no end of tobacco
and fish scale jewellery and such rubbish from Johnstone
for his work, and now that supplies had dried
up he was pretty much down in the mouth; he’d
got to connect pearls and tobacco in his woolly head,
and now the lagoon was skinned and there were no
more pearls, he saw there was to be no more tobacco,
nor jewellery, nor canned salmon.</p>

<p>“Well, that night there was a big Kanaka pow-wow
on the beach; the chaps were sitting in a ring
and talking and talking, and Bone, catching sight
of them, crawled through the bushes to listen.</p>

<p>“He heard the chief chap talking.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t make out at first what he was
jabbering about; then at last he got sense of what
he was saying.</p>

<p>“‘There’ll be no more good things,’ says he, ‘sticks
of tobacco, nor fish in cans, nor knives, nor print
calico to make breeches of, nor nothing, for,’ says
he, using a figure of speech, ‘the man with the teeth
has killed the fat one and swallowed his pearls.’</p>

<p>“Then the meeting closed and the congressmen
took their ways home, all but Kiliwakee, the half-lunatic
chap, who sits in the moonlight wagging his
fuzzy head, which was his way of thinking.</p>

<p>“Then he fetches a knife out of his loin cloth
and looks at it, then he lays on his back and begins
to strop it on his heel, same as a chap strops a razor.</p>

<p>“Bone said he’d never seen anything funnier
than that chap lying in the moonlight stropping away
at that knife. It give him a shiver, too, somehow.</p>

<p>“Well, Kiliwakee sits up again and does another
brood, feeling the sharp edge of the knife. Then,
with the knife between his teeth, he makes off on
all fours like a land crab, for the house.</p>

<p>“Bone follows.</p>

<p>“Kiliwakee listens at the house door and hears
someone snoring inside&mdash;Logan, no less; then he crawls
through the door, and Bone guessed that looney was
after the pearls. If Bone had run he’d have been
in time to save Logan, but he didn’t. He just listened.
He heard a noise like a yelp. Then, five minutes
after, out comes Kiliwakee. He’d done Logan in
and cut his stomach open, but he hadn’t found no
pearls, not knowing the chief chap had been usin’
a figure of speech.</p>

<p>“Now you know what a figure of speech is, and
don’t you forget it, and if you want to know any more
about it go and buy a grammar book. Bone&mdash;Oh,
he never got away with the schooner, nor the boodle
neither. A Chile gunboat looked into that lagoon
next week and collared the fishin’ rights and produce
in the name of Chile, and told Bone to go fight it in
the courts if he wanted to put in a claim. Said the
place had been charted and claimed by Chile two
years before, which was a lie.</p>

<p>“But Bone wasn’t up for fighting. Too much
afraid of questions being asked and the doing in
of Logan put down to him by the Kanakas.</p>

<p>“So he took a passage in the gunboat to Valdivia.
He’d six big pearls stolen from the takings and hid
in the lining of his waistcoat, and he sold them for
two hundred dollars to a Jew, and that got him back
to ’Frisco.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I don’t mind; whisky with a dash,
if it’s all the same to you.”</p>

</h2>

<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>I was sitting in front of Thibaud’s Café one evening
when I saw Lewishon, whom I had not met for
years.</p>

<p>Thibaud’s Café I must tell you first, is situated on
Coconut Square, Noumea. Noumea has a bad name,
but it is not at all a bad place if you are not a convict,
neither is New Caledonia, take it altogether, and that
evening, sitting and smoking and listening to the
band, and watching the crowd and the dusk taking
the flame trees, it seemed to me for a moment that
Tragedy had withdrawn, that there was no such place
as the Isle Nou out there in the harbour, and that
the musicians making the echoes ring to the “Sambre
et Meuse” were primarily musicians, not convicts.</p>

<p>Then I saw Lewishon crossing the Square by the
Liberty Statue, and attracted his attention. He
came and sat by me, and we smoked and talked whilst
I tried to realise that it was fifteen years since I had
seen him last, and that he hadn’t altered in the least&mdash;in
the dusk.</p>

<p>“I’ve been living here for years,” said he. “When
I saw you last in ’Frisco, I was about to take up a
proposition in Oregon. I didn’t, owing to a telegram
going wrong. That little fact changed my whole
life. I came to the Islands instead and started trading,
then I came to live in New Caledonia&mdash;I’m married.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, “is that so?”</p>

<p>Something in the tone of those two words, “I’m
married,” struck me as strange.</p>

<p>We talked on indifferent subjects, and before we
parted I promised to come over and see him next
day at his place, a few miles from the town. I did,
and I was astonished at what I saw.</p>

<p>New Caledonia, pleasant as the climate may be,
is not the place one would live in by choice. At all
events it wasn’t in those days when the convicts were
still coming there from France. The gangs of prisoners
shepherded by warders armed to the teeth, the great
barges filled with prisoners that ply every evening
when work is over between the harbour quay and the
Isle Nou, the military air of the place and the fretting
regulations, all these things and more robbed it of
its appeal as a residential neighbourhood. Yet the
Lewishons lived there, and what astonished me was
the evidence of their wealth and the fact that they
had no apparent interests at all to bind them to the
place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewishon was a woman of forty-five or so, yet
her beauty had scarcely begun to fade. I was introduced
to her by Lewishon on the broad verandah of
their house, which stood in the midst of gardens more
wonderful than the gardens of La Mortola.</p>

<p>A week or so later, after dining with me in the town,
he told me the story of his marriage, one of the strangest
stories I ever heard, and this is it, just as he told it:</p>

<p>“The Pacific is the finest place in the world to drop
money in. You see it’s so big and full of holes that
look like safe investments. I started, after I parted
with you, growing cocoanut trees in the Fijis. It
takes five years for a cocoanut palm to grow, but when
it’s grown it will bring you in an income of eighteen
pence or so a year, according as the copra prices range.
I planted forty thousand young trees, and at the end
of the fourth year a hurricane took the lot. That’s
the Pacific. I was down and out, and then I struck
luck. That’s the Pacific again. I got to be agent
for a big English firm here in Noumea, and in a short
time I was friends with everyone from Chardin the
governor right down. Chardin was a good sort, but
very severe. The former governor had been lax, so
the people said, letting rules fall into abeyance like
the rule about cropping the convicts’ hair and beards
to the same pattern. However that may have been,
Chardin had just come as governor, and I had not been
here more than a few months when one day a big white
yacht from France came and dropped anchor in the
harbour, and a day or two after a lady appeared at
my office and asked for an interview.</p>

<p>“She had heard of me through a friend, she said,
and she sought my assistance in a most difficult matter.
In plain English she wanted me to help in the escape
of a convict.</p>

<p>“I was aghast. I was about to order her out of
the office, when something&mdash;something&mdash;something,
I don’t know what, held my tongue and kept me from
rising for a moment, whilst with the cunning, which
amounts to magic, of a desperate woman in love,
she managed to calm my anger. ‘I understand,’ she
said, ‘and I should have been surprised if you had
taken the matter calmly, but will you listen to me, and
when you have heard me out, tell me if you would
not have done what I have done to-day?’</p>

<p>“I could not stop her, and this is what she told me:</p>

<p>“Her name was Madame Armand Duplessis, her
maiden name had been Alexandre. She was the only
child of Alexandre, the big sugar refiner, and at his
death she found herself a handsome young girl with a
fortune of about twenty million francs and nothing
between her and the rogues of the world but an old
maiden aunt given to piety and guileless as a rabbit.
However, she managed to escape the sharks and
married an excellent man, a Captain in the Cavalry
and attached to St. Cyr. He died shortly after the
marriage, and the young widow, left desolate and
without a child to console her, took up living again
with her aunt, or rather the aunt came to live with her
in the big house she occupied on the Avenue de la
Grande Armée.</p>

<p>“About six months after she met Duplessis. I
don’t know how she met him, she didn’t say, but
anyhow he wasn’t quite in the same circle as herself.
He was a clerk in La Fontaine’s Bank, and only drawing
a few thousand francs a year, but he was handsome
and attractive and young, and the upshot of it was
they got married.</p>

<p>“She did not know anything of his past history
and he had no family in evidence, nothing to stand
on at all but his position at the bank; but she did
not mind, she was in love and she took him on trust
and they got married. A few months after marriage
a change came over Duplessis; he had always been
given rather to melancholy, but now an acute depression
of spirits came on him for no reason apparently;
he could not sleep, his appetite failed, and the doctors,
fearing consumption, ordered him a sea voyage. When
he heard this prescription he laughed in such a strange
way that Madame Duplessis, who had been full of
anxiety as to his bodily condition, became for a
moment apprehensive as to this mental state. However,
she said nothing, keeping her fears hidden and
busying herself in preparations for the voyage.</p>

<p>“It chanced that just at that moment a friend had
a yacht to dispose of, an eight hundred ton auxiliary-engined
schooner, <i>La Gaudriole</i>. It was going cheap,
and Madame Duplessis, who was a good business
woman, bought it, reckoning to sell it again when
the voyage was over.</p>

<p>“A month later they left Marseilles.</p>

<p>“They visited Greece and the Islands; then, having
touched at Alexandria, they passed through the Canal,
came down the Red Sea and crossed the Indian Ocean.
They touched at Ceylon, and whilst there Madame
Duplessis suggested that instead of going to Madras,
as they had intended, they should go into the Pacific
by way of the Straits of Malacca. Duplessis opposed
this suggestion at first, then he fell in with it. More
than that, he became enthusiastic about it. A weight
seemed suddenly to have been lifted from his mind,
his eyes grew bright and the melancholy that all the
breezes of the Indian Ocean had not blown away
suddenly vanished.</p>

<p>“Two days later they left Ceylon, came through
the Straits of Malacca and by way of the Arafura
Sea and Torres Straits into the Pacific. The Captain
of the yacht had suggested the Santa Cruz islands as
their first stopping place, but one night Duplessis
took his wife aside and asked her would she mind their
making for New Caledonia instead. Then he gave
his reason.</p>

<p>“He said to her: ‘When you married me I told
you I had no family; that was not quite the truth.
I have a brother. He is a convict serving sentence
in Noumea. I did not tell you because the thing was
painful to me as death.’</p>

<p>“You can fancy her feelings, struck by a bombshell
like that, but she says nothing and he goes on telling
her the yarn he ought to have told her before they were
married.</p>

<p>“This brother, Charles Duplessis, had been rather a
wild young scamp; he lived in the Rue du Mont
Thabor, a little street behind the Rue St. Honoré in
Paris, and he made his money on the Stock Exchange.
Then he got into terrible trouble. He was accused
of a forgery committed by another man, but could
not prove his innocence. Armand was certain of his
innocence but could do nothing, and Charles was convicted
and sent to New Caledonia.</p>

<p>“Well, Madame Duplessis sat swallowing that
fact, and when he’d done speaking, she sat swallowing
some more as if her throat was dry. Then she says
to Armand:</p>

<p>“‘Your brother is innocent, then,’ she says.</p>

<p>“‘As innocent as yourself,’ he answers her, ‘and
it is the knowledge of all this that has caused my
illness and depression.</p>

<p>“‘Before I was married I was forgetting it all, but
married to the woman I love, rich, happy, with
enviable surroundings, Charles came and knocked
at my door, saying: “Remember me in your
happiness.”’</p>

<p>“‘But can we do nothing for him?’ asked Madame
Duplessis.</p>

<p>“‘Nothing,’ replied Armand, ‘unless we can help
him to escape.’</p>

<p>“Then he went on to tell her how he had not wanted
to come on this long voyage at first, feeling that there
was some fate in the business, and that it would surely
bring him somehow or another to Noumea; then,
how the idea had come to him at Ceylon that he might
be able to help Charles to escape.</p>

<p>“She asked him had he any plan, and he replied
that he had not and that it was impossible to make
any plan till he reached Noumea and studied the place
and its possibilities.</p>

<p>“Well, there was the position the woman found
herself in, and a nice position it was. Think of it,
married only a short time and now condemned to help
a prisoner to escape from New Caledonia, for, though
she could easily have refused, she felt compelled to
the business both for the sake of her husband and
the sake of his brother, an innocent man wrongfully
convicted.</p>

<p>“She agreed to help in the attempt like the high
spirited woman she was, and a few days later they
raised the New Caledonia reef and the Noumea lighthouse
that marks the entrance to the harbour.</p>

<p>“Madame Duplessis had a big acquaintance in Paris,
especially among the political and military people,
and no sooner had the yacht berthed than the Governor
and chief people who knew her name, began to show
their attentions, tumbling over themselves with invitations
to dinners and parties.</p>

<p>“That, again, was a nice position for her, having to
accept the hospitality of the people she had come to
betray, so to speak, but she had to do it: it was the
only way to help her husband along in his scheme, and
leaving the yacht, she took up her residence in a house
she rented on the sea road; you may have seen it, a
big white place with green verandahs, and there
she and her husband spent their time whilst the yacht
was being overhauled.</p>

<p>“They gave dinners and parties and went to picnics;
they regularly laid themselves out to please, and then,
one night, Armand came to his wife and said that he
had been studying all means of escape from Noumea,
and he had found only one. He would not say what it
was, and she was content not to poke into the business,
leaving him to do the plotting and planning till the
time came when she could help.</p>

<p>“Armand said that before he could do anything
in the affair he must first have an interview with
Charles. They were hand in glove with the Governor,
and it was easy enough to ask to see a prisoner, but
the bother was the name of Duplessis, for Charles
had been convicted and exported under that name.
The Governor had never noticed Charles, and the name
of Duplessis was in the prison books and forgotten.
It would mean raking the whole business up and
claiming connection with a convict, still it had to be
done.</p>

<p>“Next day Armand called at the Governor’s house
and had an interview. He told the Governor that a
relation named Charles Duplessis was amongst the
convicts and that he very much wanted to have an
interview with him.</p>

<p>“Now the laws at that time were very strict, and the
Governor, though pretty lax in some things as I’ve
said, found himself up against a stiff proposition, and
that proposition was how to tell Armand there was
nothing doing.</p>

<p>“‘I am sorry,’ said the Governor, ‘but what you
ask is impossible, Monsieur Duplessis; a year ago it
would have been easy enough, but since the escape
of Benonini and that Englishman Travers, the orders
from Paris have forbidden visitors: any message you
would like me to send to your relation shall be sent,
but an interview&mdash;no.’</p>

<p>“Then Armand played his ace of trumps. He
confessed, swearing the Governor to secrecy, that
Charles was his brother; he said that Charles had in
his possession a family secret that it was vital to
obtain. He talked and talked, and the upshot was
that the Governor gave in.</p>

<p>“Charles would be brought by two warders to the
house on the Sea Road after dark on the following
day, the interview was to take place in a room with a
single door and single window. One warder was to
guard the door on the outside, the other would stand
below the window. The whole interview was not to
last longer than half an hour.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>“Next evening after dark steps sounded on the
path up to the house with the green verandahs.
Madame Duplessis had retired to her room; she had
dismissed the servants for the evening, and Armand
himself opened the door. One of those little ten-cent
whale oil lamps was the only light in the passage, but
it was enough for Armand to see the forms of the
warders and another form, that of his brother.</p>

<p>“The warders, unlike the Governor, weren’t particular
about trifles; they didn’t bother about guarding
doors and windows, sure of being able to pot anyone
who made an attempt to leave the house, they sat
on the fence in the moonlight counting the money
Armand had given them, ten napoleons apiece.</p>

<p>“Half an hour passed, during which Madame Duplessis
heard voices in argument from the room below,
and then she heard the hall door open as Charles went
out. Charles shaded his eyes against the moon,
saw the warders approaching him from the fence,
and walked off with them back to the prison he had
come from.</p>

<p>“Then Madame Duplessis, hearing the front door
close, came from her room, and found her husband
in the passage.</p>

<p>“He seemed overcome by the interview with his
brother.</p>

<p>“She asked him had he made plans for Charles’
escape, and he answered: ‘No.’ Then he went on
to say that escape was impossible. They had talked
the whole thing over and had come to that decision.
She stood there in the hall listening to him, wondering
dimly what had happened, for only a few hours before
he had been full of plans and energy and now this
interview seemed to have crushed all the life out of
him.</p>

<p>“Then she said: ‘If that is so there is no use
in our remaining any longer at Noumea.’ He agreed
with her and went off to his room, leaving her there
wondering more than ever what could have happened
to throw everything out of gear in that way.</p>

<p>“She was a high-spirited woman and she had thought
little of the danger of the business; pitying Charles,
she did not mind risking her liberty to set him free,
and the thought that her husband had funked the
business came to her suddenly as she stood there, like
a stab in the heart.</p>

<p>“She went off to her room and went to bed, but she
could not sleep for thinking, and the more she thought
the clearer it seemed to her that her husband brought
up to scratch had got cold feet as the Yankees say,
and had backed out of the show, leaving Charles to
his fate.</p>

<p>“She was more sure next morning, for he kept away
from her, had breakfast early and went off into the
town shopping. But the shock of her life came to her
at dinner time, for when he turned up for the meal,
it was plain to be seen he had been drinking more
than was good for him&mdash;trying to drown the recollections
of his own weakness, it seemed to her.</p>

<p>“She had never seen him under the influence before,
and she was shocked at the change it made in him.
She left the table.</p>

<p>“Afterwards she was sorry that she did that, for
it was like the blow of an axe between them. Next
morning he would scarcely speak to her, and the day
after they were due to leave for France.</p>

<p>“They were due out at midday, and at eleven
Duplessis, who had lingered in the town to make some
purchases, had not come on board. He did not turn
up till half an hour after the time they were due
to sail, and when he did it was plain to be seen that
all his purchases had been made in cafés.</p>

<p>“He was flushed, and laughing and joking with the
boatman who brought him off, and his wife, seeing his
condition, went below and left the deck to him&mdash;a
nice position for a woman on board a yacht like that
with all the sailors looking on, to say nothing of the
captain and officers. However, there was nothing
to be done, and she had to make the best of it, which
she did by avoiding her husband as much as she could
right from that on, for the chap had gone clean off
the handle; it was as if his failure to be man enough to
rescue his brother had pulled a linch-pin out of one
of his wheels, and the drink which he flew to for
consolation finished the business.</p>

<p>“They stopped at Colombo and he went ashore,
and they were three days getting him back, and when
he came he looked like a sack of meal in the stern sheets
of the pinnace. They stopped at Port Said and he got
ashore again without any money, but that was nothing,
for a chap coming off a yacht like that gets all the
tick he wants for anything in Port Said. He was a
week there, and was only got away by the captain of
the yacht knocking seven bells out of him with his
fists, and then handing the carcase to two quartermasters
to take on board ship.</p>

<p>“They stopped nowhere else till they reached
Marseilles, and there they found Madame Duplessis’
lawyer waiting for them, having been notified by cable
from Port Said.</p>

<p>“A doctor was had in and he straightened Armand
up with strychnine and bromide, and they brushed
his hair and shaved him and stuck him in a chair
for a family conference, consisting of Madame
Duplessis, the old maiden aunt, Armand and the
lawyer.</p>

<p>“Armand had no fight in him; he looked mighty
sorry for himself, but offered no explanations or excuses,
beyond saying that the drink had got into his
head. Madame Duplessis, on the other hand, was out
for scalps&mdash;Do you wonder? Fancy that voyage
all the way back with a husband worse than drunk.
When I say worse than drunk, I mean that this chap
wasn’t content to take his booze and carry on as a
decent man would have done. No, sir. He embroidered
on the business without the slightest thought
of his wife. An ordinary man full up with liquor
and with a wife towing round would have tried to
have hidden his condition as far as he could, but this
blighter carried on regardless, and, when the whisky
was in, wasn’t to hold or bind.</p>

<p>“Of course she recognised that something in his
brain had given way, and she took into account that
he was plainly trying to drown the recollection of his
cowardice in not helping Charles to escape; all the same
she was out for scalps and said so.</p>

<p>“She said she would live with him no more, that
she had been a fool to marry a man whom she had
only known for a few months and of whose family
she knew nothing. She said she would give him an
allowance of a thousand francs a month if he would
sheer off and get out of her sight and never let her see
him again.</p>

<p>“He sat listening to all this without a sign of shame,
and when she’d finished he flattened her out by calmly
asking for fifteen hundred a month instead of a thousand.
Never said he was sorry; just asked for a bigger
allowance as if he was talking to a business man he
was doing a deal with instead of a wife he had injured
and outraged. Even the old lawyer was sick, and it
takes a lot to sicken a French lawyer. I can tell you
that.</p>

<p>“What does she do? She says: ‘I’ll allow you
two thousand a month on the condition I never see
your face or hear from you again. If you show yourself
before me,’ she says, ‘or write to me, I’ll stop the
allowance&mdash;if you try to move the law to make us live
together, I’ll turn all my money into gold coin and
throw it in the sea and myself after it, you beast,’
she says.</p>

<p>“And he says: ‘All right, all right, don’t fly away
with things,’ he says. ‘Give me my allowance and
you’ll never see me again.’</p>

<p>“Then he signs a paper to that effect, and she leaves
him at Marseilles and goes back to Paris to take up
her life as if she had never been married.</p>

<p>“Back in Paris she felt as if she’d been through a
nightmare. You see she’d loved the chap, that was
the bother. And the rum part of the thing was she
couldn’t unlove him. That’s to say she couldn’t
forget him. She couldn’t forget the man he’d been.
Seemed to her as if some frightful accident had turned
his nature and that it wasn’t altogether his fault,
and she guessed that it wasn’t only his funking his duty
that had changed him, but that Charles, away out
there in New Caledonia, was haunting him.</p>

<p>“Then, after a while, being a rich woman, she
managed, unknown to anyone, to get news of what he
was doing and how he was carrying on, and what she
found out didn’t comfort her any. He was up in
Montmartre with another woman and going to pieces
fast, what with living all his time in cafés and drinking
and so on. She reckoned she wouldn’t be paying his
allowance long, and she was right.</p>

<p>“One day an old woman turned up at her house
asking her to come at once to where he was living
as he was mortally ill and couldn’t hold out more than
a few hours.</p>

<p>“She didn’t think twice, but came, taking a cab
and being landed in a little old back street at the door
of a house that stood between a thieves’ café and a rag
shop.</p>

<p>“Up the stairs she went, following the old woman,
and into a room where his royal highness was lying
with a jug of whisky on the floor beside him and a
hectic blush on his cheeks.</p>

<p>“‘I’m dying,’ he says, ‘and I want to tell you
something you ought to know. I was sent to New
Caledonia,’ he says, ‘for a robbery committed by
another man.’</p>

<p>“She thought he was raving, but she says, ‘Go on.’</p>

<p>“‘Armand and I were twins,’ he says, ‘as like as
two peas. Armand could do nothing. He stayed
in Paris whilst poor Charles, that’s me, went making
roads on Noumea. Then you married him.’</p>

<p>“‘But you are Armand,’ she cries, ‘you are my
husband, or am I mad?’</p>

<p>“‘Not a bit,’ says he, ‘I’m Charles, his twin
brother.’</p>

<p>“Then she recollected how from the first she
thought Armand had changed. She sat down on the
side of the bed because her limbs were giving, and he
goes on.</p>

<p>“‘A year ago, you and him came in a big yacht
to Noumea, and the Governor sent me one night
to have a talk with him. When we were alone, he
told me how his heart had been burning a hole in
him for years, how he had married a rich woman&mdash;that’s
you&mdash;and how, when he was happy and rich
his heart had burned him worse, so that the doctors
not knowing what was wrong with him had ordered
him a sea voyage.’ Then Charles goes on to tell
how Armand had come to the conclusion that even
if he helped Charles to escape, this likeness between
them would lead surely to the giving away of the
whole show, make trouble among the crew of the
yacht, and so on&mdash;besides the fact that it was next
to impossible for a man to escape from Noumea in
the ordinary way, but said Armand, ‘We can change
places, and no one will know. Strip and change
here and now,’ he says; ‘the guards are outside. I’ll
take your place and go to prison, and you’ll be free.
I’ve got a scissors here and two snips will make our
hair the same, and by good luck we are both clean
shaven. You’ve done half your sentence of ten
years, and I’ll do the other half,’ he says; ‘the only
bargain I’ll make is that you’ll respect my wife and
live apart from her, and, after a while, you’ll break
the news to her, and, maybe, when I’m free in five
years she’ll forgive me.’</p>

<p>“Charles finishes up by excusing himself for the
drink, saying if she’d served five years without the
chance of a decent wet all that time, she’d maybe
have done as he’d done.</p>

<p>“He died an hour after, and there was that woman
left with lots to think about. First of all her husband
wasn’t the drunkard that had disgraced her, but he
was a convict serving his time and serving it wrongfully
for a robbery he had not committed and for
the sake of his brother.</p>

<p>“The thundering great fact stood up like a shot
tower before her that Armand wasn’t the drunkard
that had disgraced her in two ports and before a
ship’s company, wasn’t the swine that took her
allowance and asked for more. That he was a saint,
if ever a man was a saint.</p>

<p>“She rushed home, telegraphed to Marseilles and
re-commissioned the <i>Gaudriole</i>, that was still lying
at the wharves. A week later she sailed again for
Noumea.</p>

<p>“On the voyage, she plotted and planned. She
had determined to save him from the four years or
so of the remains of his sentence at all costs and
hazards, and when the yacht put in here she had
a plan fixed on, but it was kiboshed by the fact that
the Governor, as I have said, was changed. However,
she took up residence for awhile in the town,
people she had known before called on her, and she
gave out that her husband was dead.</p>

<p>“You can fancy how a rich widow was run after
by all and sundry, myself included, not that I had
any idea about her money. I only cared for herself.
She knew this as women know such things by instinct,
and one day when she was alone with me and I was
going to tell her my mind about her, she dropped a
bombshell on my head by telling me her whole story,
capped by the fact that she had come to help her
husband to escape. She asked for my help. I’m
a queer chap in some ways. I told her I loved her
enough to ruin myself for her by risking everything
to give her husband back to her, and between us we
worked out a plan that was a pippin.</p>

<p>“It would have freed Armand, only that we found
on inquiring about him that he had already escaped&mdash;he
was dead. Died of fever two months before she
came.</p>

<p>“I heard once of a Japanese child that said her
doll was alive because she loved it so much, adding
that if you loved anything enough it lived. Well,
in my experience, if you love anything enough you
can make it love you.</p>

<p>“That woman stayed on in Noumea, and I made
her love me at last. I married her, you know her,
she is my wife. She loves Armand still, as a memory,
and for the sake of his memory we live here. It’s
as good a place to live in as anywhere else, especially
now that they have settled to send no more convicts
from France.”</p>

</h2>

<div class='secn'>I</div>

<p class='ni'>A man may live all his days without finding his
true vocation, and it is often accident that
reveals it to him. Herschel might have ended his
days a music master only for chance, and Du Maurier
towards the finish of his life found that he had been
all his life a novelist without knowing it.</p>

<p>Some years ago my friend John Sargenson found on
the beach near Dover an old red satin shoe that had
been washed ashore tied to a bundle of papers. I
have told the story elsewhere and how, brooding
over these things, and by powers of analysis and
synthesis rarely linked in one brain, he solved the
riddle and brought a murderer to justice.</p>

<p>He didn’t continue in the business. He is a very
rich man, and God’s beautiful world offers him better
objects of pursuit than the crook and criminal; all
the same, a year after the shoe business, accident
brought him again in touch with a problem. He
took the thing up, followed it to its solution and now
he wishes he hadn’t. This is the story as he told
me it.</p>

<div class='secn'>II</div>

<p>I don’t know what it is about travelling that palls
on one so much if one is travelling alone, maybe it’s the
fact that the perfectly friendly people one meets are
dead strangers to one, for all their conversation and
close propinquity; a sea and land journey round
the world is, in this respect, nothing more than a
magnified bus ride, passengers getting in and out,
talking together and so forth, but dead to one another
once the destination is reached.</p>

<p>It was at Rangoon that this great fact hit me,
and incidentally laid the keel of the yarn I promised
to tell you. I was suddenly fed up with boats, trains,
hotels and strangers, homesick down to the heels of
my boots, and wanting some place of my own to
hide in; anything, even a shack in the jungle. It
was the queerest feeling, and one day when it was
gripping me hard, I fell in talk in the hotel bar with
an old saltwater chap by name of Boston, who owned
boats on the Irawadi and a couple of deep-sea
schooners. I told him what was in my mind and he
understood. He took me by the arm and led me
off down to the river, and pointing out a schooner
tied up to the wharf:</p>

<p>“There you are,” said he, “that’s what you want;
she’s in ballast and ready for sea. She’s mine.
Buy her, or rent her. She’s a hundred and ten tons
and nothing can break her, best sea boat in these
waters; she’ll take you to Europe safer than the
mails, and I’ll get you a skipper and crew inside the
week.”</p>

<p>An hour after I had closed, and the <i>Itang</i>&mdash;that
was her name&mdash;was mine. I’d found a home. A
week later I was off, slipping down the Irawadi
with the land breeze into the Gulf of Martaban, bound
for Europe?&mdash;oh Lord, no! I was homesick no
longer; Europe might have gone off the map as far
as I was concerned, for the Pacific was calling
me.</p>

<p>We sailed south down by the Andamans and
through the Straits of Malacca, past Java and Flores,
into the Banda Sea, tinkered about amongst the
islands and then came through Torres Straits; it
was May and the south-east monsoon was blowing&mdash;you
can’t get through that place when the north-west
is on, because of the fogs&mdash;then steering north by
the Louisiades, we passed the Solomons, touched at
several of the Carolines and pushed on till we were
about half-way between the Ladrones and Wake
Island just under 20° North.</p>

<p>That’s where the happening took place.</p>

<p>One blazing hot morning just as I was turning
out of my bunk Mallinson, the skipper, came down
to report a boat sighted drifting and derelict away
ahead on the port bow.</p>

<p>I came up in my pyjamas, and there she was, sure
enough, a ship’s boat, with no sign of life and evidently
no dead bodies in her, for she was riding high and
dancing to the sea like a walnut-shell, but stuck up
in the bow of her there was something like a bit
of white board fixed to a spar of some sort.</p>

<p>Through the glass Mallinson made out something
on the board that he said was writing. I couldn’t;
it looked like black lines to me, but he was right.</p>

<p>We closed up with her, dropped a boat, and I put
off with Hogg the mate, the <i>Itang</i> keeping to windward
on the off-chance of infection. Mallinson had
it in his head that the notice on the board might be
a warning of smallpox or plague, or something like
that, and he’d once been had badly by picking up a
plague boat off the Maldives. But it wasn’t.</p>

<p>The notice had nothing to do with disease or infection,
and I’ll give you a hundred guesses as to what
some old ship master, maybe dying and half crazy
with the loss of his ship, and a secret on his conscience
had written up for some passing ship to read.</p>

<p>This was it:</p>

<p class='ni' style='margin-left:2em;margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em;'>“The heir of William Abbott will be found at<br />
11 Churles Street, Shanghai.”</p>

<p>I don’t mind saying that no sailor man has ever
struck anything at sea stranger than that. You
must remember where we were: a thousand miles of
blue ocean all around and that piece of writing
staring us in the face; the affairs of William Abbott
and his heir, whoever they might be, contrasted
with God’s immensities&mdash;an advertisement, almost,
you might say, written on that desolation.</p>

<p>It struck me clean between the eyes, it was like
meeting a man in a top hat in the middle of the
Sahara desert. We closed up with the boat; she was
clean swept of everything down to the bailer, no
ship’s name on her, and worth maybe a hundred
dollars; so we towed her to the <i>Itang</i> and got her
on board, notice and all.</p>

<p>It was lashed to a boat-hook, which was lashed to
the forward thwart, and we cut it loose and brought
it down to the cabin, where we hung it up as a trophy.</p>

<p>After the word “Shanghai” there was the indication
of a letter that looked like “L,” faint as if the
paint had run out or the fellow who was writing
had given up the job, dying maybe, before he could
finish it; the board itself was an old piece of white
enamelled stuff, torn evidently from some part of
a ship’s make-up, the whole thing was roughly done,
but the chap, whoever he was, had some education,
for there was a punctuation mark after the word
“Street.”</p>

<p>We stuck it up on the after bulkhead, and there it
hung, giving us food for talk every meal time, and on
and off for days. Mallinson said it was the work
of some chap who had died and left no will, he was
a bit of a sea lawyer and he held that if William
Abbott was a sailor and it could be proved he was
lost at sea and if some relation of his was to be found
at 11 Churles Street, Shanghai, the Law, under the
circumstance, would regard the thing as a will.</p>

<p>This seemed to me rubbish, but it gave us something
to argue about, and so it went on till the thing dropped
from our talk as we raised our latitude, looking in
at Los Jardines and then steering for Formosa.</p>

<p>I’d determined to have a look at Japan, so we left
Formosa, steering north, and then one day, it was
off the Riu Kiu islands, the helm went over and we
steered for Shanghai.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter was that beastly board
had obsessed me. Though we had ceased talking
of it, I hadn’t ceased thinking of it. You know the
way a problem gets hold of me. Lying in my bunk
at night, I worked that riddle backwards and forwards,
and up and down. If William Abbott had
written it, what had become of him? Why wasn’t
his corpse in the boat? What was the use of writing
it? As a legal document, it was useless. The
whole thing was a tangle, but one fact stood out,
it was a message. Well, to whom? Not to the seagulls
or the world at large, but to the first person who
should pick it up, and the message was:</p>

<p>“The heir of William Abbott lives at such and such
an address.” That was quite plain. Also it was
evident that the writer meant that the finder of the
message should make use of it by bringing it to or
sending it to 11 Churles Street.</p>

<p>Whether some man at the address given could
benefit by the message or not was another matter&mdash;evidently
it was in the mind of the writer that he
could.</p>

<p>You see how reasoning had brought me to a point
where conscience was awakened. I began to say
to myself: “It’s your duty to take that message;
here you are a well-to-do idler bound for no port in
particular, but just following your own pleasure, you
are going to Japan for no earthly reason, just for
a whim, Shanghai lies almost on your way and your
duty is to stop there,” but I didn’t want to go to
Shanghai, I had nothing against the place or the
Chinese&mdash;I just didn’t want to go; however, that
didn’t matter, conscience had taken the wheel and
I went.</p>

<div class='secn'>III</div>

<p>We got to the river before noon one day and picked
up a pilot. You don’t know Shanghai? Well,
you’re saved the knowledge of the shoals and buoys
and lightships and the currents, and the five-mile-long
anchorage, to say nothing of the freighters going
up and down and the junks out of control. I cursed
William Abbott and his heirs before we were berthed,
and then, leaving Mallinson in charge, I went ashore
to hunt for my man.</p>

<p>I knew Lockhart, the silk man, and found him
out, and he made me stop with him at his place all
the time I was there, which was only three days.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting place, Shanghai, but the thing
that intrigued me most was the fact that there was
no Churles Street. Thinking the Johnnie who wrote
the notice might have meant Charles Street, I asked
for that; there was no such place in the European
quarter. The European quarter lies east of the
Chinese town. There was no such place in the
Chinese town, there was the street of a Thousand
Delights and the street of the Seven Dead Dogs, and
the street of the Lanterns, and so forth, but they were
no use, so, feeling that I was done and shaking the
dried mud of Shanghai off my shoes, we put out for
Nagasaki.</p>

<p>I sent the notice board flying over the after rail
as we dropped the land and dismissed the matter
from my mind&mdash;from my conscious mind. My
subliminal mind had it still in hand, and two days
after landing at Nagasaki it asked me this question:
“Could that faintly written ‘L’ have been the
first letter of the word ‘lost’?”</p>

<p>I went straight to the shipping office and, looking
over the list of overdue ships, I found a notice that
the steamship <i>Shanghai</i>, bound from London to Canton
was eight weeks overdue. You can imagine how the
hound in me woke to life and wagged its tail at that
discovery. I sat down and wrote out on a sheet
of paper the message, amended into this: “The
heir of William Abbott lives at 11 Churles Street.
Shanghai lost.” If the writer had possessed the time
and paint and space he might have given the full
strange history of the case and how the boat had been
drifted off and about the seas with that message.</p>

<p>Maybe the chap had jumped to the sharks, driven
by hunger or thirst as many a man has done, maybe
he had painted his message on that bit of board before
leaving some slowly sinking ship and taken it in the
boat&mdash;no knowing, the fact remained, and seemed
clear enough, that some desperate urgency of soul
had made him, in face of death and with a steady
hand, take a paint brush and write that screed on the
bare chance of someone picking it up.</p>

<p>You know my make-up and how, having gone so
far on an inquiry of this sort, I was bound to go on.
It’s different now. I’ll never touch a thing like that
again, but that day I stripped for action, determining
to see the business through and find out every bit of
meaning there was to it.</p>

<p>I started by sending a cable to the Board of Trade,
London Docks. Next day at noon I had an answer
which read: “<i>Shanghai</i> sixteen hundred tons, Master’s
name Richard Abbott.”</p>

<p>That name Abbott coming over the wires all the
way from murky London, in answer, you might say,
to the name Abbott written on that board away
in the blue Pacific, gave me a thrill such as I have
never felt before. I knew now the writer of the
message, and at the same time I knew that it was
not his own money that he was bothering about
simply because he wasn’t William Abbott. I knew
that it was highly probable that he was a close relation
of William Abbott, brother maybe, or son; that
might be placed among the high probabilities owing
to the similarity of name and intimate knowledge
of family affairs. Just so, and I could go a step
further; it was pretty certain that Richard Abbott,
the master of the <i>Shanghai</i>, was the sole possessor
of the knowledge he had given to the world, and,
from the urge that drove him in the face of death
to tell what he knew, it was possible that the thing
weighed on his mind, possible, in fact, that he had
kept the thing hidden.</p>

<p>In other words, that he was trying to remedy
an injustice committed either by himself or someone
else.</p>

<p>I wrote all these probabilities and possibilities
down on a sheet of paper, with an account of the
finding of the message, sealed the lot up in an envelope
and gave it in charge of the manager of the bank
I dealt with in Nagasaki, so that in the case of death
or accident the heir of William Abbott might have
some chance of coming to his due. Then I proceeded
to enjoy myself in Japan, determined to think no more
of the matter till I got back to London.</p>

<p>I spent a month in Japan, sold the old <i>Itang</i> for
more than I had given for her and paid off captain
and crew.</p>

<div class='secn'>IV</div>

<p>I made up my mind that the Churles Street referred
to in the message lay in London. London was the
home town evidently of the master of the <i>Shanghai</i>,
and he would refer to Churles Street&mdash;perhaps a well-known
place in the dock quarter&mdash;just as one might
speak of Cromwell Road or Regent Street.</p>

<p>On getting in to Southampton, the first thing I
did at the hotel was to consult a Kelly’s directory,
and sure enough, there was Churles Street, E.C., the
only street of that name, a short street of twenty
houses or so with the name J. Robertson against
No. 11. The street opened off the West India Dock
Road, and two days later, when I had disposed of my
private business in London, I took a walk in the
East End. The Dock Road is a fascinating place
if you are in good health and spirits, and if the day
is fine, but there is no fascination about Churles
Street, a gloomy, evil looking cul-de-sac, not rowdy,
but quiet with the quietude of vice reduced to misery
and crouching in a corner.</p>

<p>It was a horrible place.</p>

<p>A thin woman nursing a baby was standing at the
door of No. 11. I asked her was anyone of the
name of Abbott living there and she glanced me
up and down.</p>

<p>“Have you come from his brother?” asked she.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “I’ve come from Captain Richard
Abbott.”</p>

<p>She led the way into the passage, opened a door,
and showed me into a room where a man, fully dressed,
was lying on a bed smoking a pipe and reading a
sporting paper.</p>

<p>A typical lounger and ne’er-do-well, unshaved, and
with his collar and tie on the chair beside him, this
chap gave me pause, I can assure you.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said to the woman, “what’s he want?”</p>

<p>“You’re his brother?” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “I’m his brother, and who
might you be?”</p>

<p>“Met him abroad,” I replied, “and he asked me
to call in and see how you were doing.” I was clean
cut off from the business I had in mind, some instinct
told me to halt right there and show nothing that
was in my hand. The man repulsed me.</p>

<p>“Well, you see how I am doing,” replied he, “hasn’t
he sent me anything but his kind inquiries?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “he asked me to give you a
sovereign from him.”</p>

<p>I brought out the money and he took it and laid
it on the chair by the collar and tie, then he filled his
pipe again and we talked. I had taken a chair which
the woman had dusted. I talked but I could get
nothing much out of him, to ask questions I would
have had to explain, and to explain might have
meant bringing this unshaven waster on top of me to
help him to prosecute his claims. If I did anything
further in the matter, I would do it through an agent,
but upon my word I felt I had paid any debt I might
owe to the master of the <i>Shanghai</i> by the trouble
I had taken already and the sovereign I had handed
over in his name.</p>

<p>As we talked a pretty little girl of ten or twelve
ran into the room; she was dirty and neglected, and
as she stood at the end of the bed with her great
eyes fixed on me, I could have kicked the loafer lying
there, his pipe in his mouth and his sporting paper
by his side.</p>

<p>It seemed that he had four children altogether, and
as I took my leave and the woman showed me out,
I put another sovereign into her hand for the children.</p>

<p>There I was in the West India Dock Road again
feeling that I could have kicked myself. It was not
so much the trouble I had taken over the business
that worried me as the wind up. I’d put into
Shanghai, sent cables from Japan, altered my plans,
spent no end of money to bring news to that rotten
chap, news of a fortune that if secured would certainly
be burst on racing and drink.</p>

<p>I said to myself that this came of mixing in other folks’
business and I took an oath never to do it again&mdash;I
didn’t know I was only at the beginning of things.</p>

<p>Murchison was the agent I determined to employ
to finish up the affair. Murchison is less a detective
than an inquiry agent, his game is to find out facts
relative to people, he lives in Old Serjeants’ Inn, and
knowing him to be secrecy itself and not caring to
employ my lawyer, I determined to go to him next
day and place the matter in his hands, telling him
to do what he could with the business, but to keep
my name out of it. He need mention nothing about
the finding of the message, but he could give it as
coming from some unknown source&mdash;the message
was the main thing, anyhow.</p>

<p>I called at his office next morning. Murchison is a
thin old chap, dry as a stick. I told him the whole
story and it made no more impression on him than if
I’d been telling it to a pump. He made a note or two,
and when I had finished, he told me in effect that he
wasn’t a District Messenger, but an inquiry agent,
and that I had better take the thing to my lawyer.
He seemed put out; I had evidently raised his tracking
instincts by my story and ended simply by asking
him to take a message.</p>

<p>I apologised, told him the truth, that my lawyer
was an old-fashioned family solicitor, gone in years,
touchy as Lucifer, the last man in London to set
hinting of possible fortunes to beggars in slums.
“If you won’t do it yourself,” I finished, “tell me of
a man who will.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you of plenty,” he replied, “but if
you take my advice you will let me make an inquiry
into the business before you move further in the
matter; there’s more in it than meets the eye and you
may be doing injury to other parties by stirring up
the mud, for this man you tell me of seems mud.”</p>

<p>“A jolly good name for him,” said I. “Well, go
ahead and make your inquiries; it’s only a few pounds
more thrown after the rest, and it will be interesting
to hear the result.” Then I left him.</p>

<p>A month later I got a letter asking me to call upon
him, and I went.</p>

<p>When I took my seat he sent the clerk for the Abbott
documents, and the clerk brought a sheaf of all sorts of
papers, laid them on the table and went out. Murchison
put on his glasses, took a glance through the papers
and started his yarn.</p>

<p>Beautifully concise it was, and I’ll give you it almost
in his own words.</p>

<div class='secn'>V</div>

<p>William Abbott, of Sydney, N.S.W., was a wool
broker who came to England in the year 1906 and died
worth some hundred and fifty thousand pounds. He
had three sons, John, Alexander and Richard.</p>

<p>The Will was simple and direct. Murchison laid a
copy of it before me, taken by permission of Abbott’s
lawyer’s, whom he had found, and it ran something
like this.</p>

<p>“Owing to the conduct of my eldest son, John
Abbott, I hereby revoke my Will of June 7th, 1902,
by which I bequeathed him the whole of my property,
with the exception of the sum of twenty thousand
pounds to be equally divided between my sons Alexander
and Richard. I hereby bequeath the whole of
my property to my son Alexander Abbott. Signed:
William Abbott, July 10th, 1904. Witnesses: John
Brooke, Jane Summers.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Murchison, as I handed the paper
back, “that signature is a forgery; the body of the
document is written as if by a clerk in almost print
character, but though I have never seen the handwriting
of William Abbott, I will bet my reputation
that the signature is forged.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because the signatures of the witnesses are forged;
they have both been written by the same hand.
The signature ‘William Abbott’ has evidently been
carefully copied from an original, there is a constraint
about it that tells me that, but the witnesses’ signatures,
where the forger had nothing to copy and had to
invent imaginary names, simply shout. The fool
never thought of that; leaving the point of similarity
aside, the woman’s signature is as masculine as a
Grenadier. The body of the document, though almost
in print, is also the work of the forger.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” said he, “handwriting with me
is not only a science which I have studied for fifty
years; it is something that has developed in me an
instinct. Now to go on. Alexander Abbott lives
in a big house down in Kent. Richard, at the time
of his father’s death, was a captain in the Black Bird
Line, evidently working for his bread. A year after
his father’s death he bought the steamer <i>Shanghai</i>,
paying a large sum for it spot cash. He was an
unmarried man, and when ashore occupied a flat in
Bayswater. Alexander is a widower with one daughter.&mdash;That’s
all. The case is complete.”</p>

<p>“How do you read it?” I asked. The old chap
fetched a snuff box out of a drawer in the desk, took
a pinch and put the box back without offering it.</p>

<p>“I read it,” he said, “in this way. John, the
eldest son, was a bad lot; the father may have intended
to disinherit him, and make a second will; anyhow,
he didn’t; put it off as men do. When the father died,
Alexander boldly did the trick. Richard may have
been party to the business, at first&mdash;who knows?
Anyhow, it seems that he was later on, since he was
able to plank that big sum down for the ship, and
since he was left nothing in the will, and since, as you
say, he put up that notice you took off the boat and
which told the truth.”</p>

<p>I said nothing for a while, thinking this thing over.
I was sure Murchison was right.</p>

<p>This thing would have been weighing in the sailor’s
mind for years; from what I could make out at Churles
Street he had evidently been making John some sort
of allowance; one could fancy the long watches of the
night, the pacing of the deck under the stars, and the
mind of the sailor always teased by the fact that he
was party to this business, a forgery that had kept
a brother, however bad, out of his inheritance. Then
the last frantic attempt to put things right in the
face of death, the agonised thought that to write the
thing on paper was useless, paper that would be washed
away by the rain or blown away by the wind.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I to Murchison, “it seems plain enough,
and now, on the face of it, what would you advise me
to do?”</p>

<p>“If I were in your place,” said he, “I would do
nothing. You say this elder brother is a scamp;
Alexander, on the other hand, is a rogue; if you mix
yourself up in the business you may have trouble.
Why should you worry yourself about a bad lot of
strangers?&mdash;turn it down.”</p>

<p>That seemed sensible enough, but you see Murchison
knew only the bare facts of the case; he had not seen
that notice board tossing about in the desolation of
the Pacific.</p>

<p>I left him without having made up my mind as to
what I should do, half determined to do nothing.</p>

<p>The bother was that the facts Murchison had put
before me gave a new complexion to the whole business,
a new urgency to that message which I had not
delivered. I felt as if the captain of the <i>Shanghai</i>
had suddenly come to my elbow, him and his uneasy
conscience craving to be put at rest. Just so, but on
the other hand there was John Abbott, and I can’t
tell you the grue that chap had given me. It wasn’t
that he was a boozer, or a waster; he was bad; bad
right through and rotten. There is a sixth sense, it has
to do with morals and the difference between good
and evil; it told me this chap was evil, and the thought
of helping to hand him a fortune made my soul revolt.</p>

<p>Still, there you are, I didn’t make the chap, and the
fact remained that in doing nothing I was holding
him out of his rights.</p>

<p>All that evening the thing worried me and most of
that night. Next morning I couldn’t stand it any
longer. I took the train for Oakslot in Kent. I
had determined to go straight to Alexander Abbott,
beard him, tell him of the notice I had found and see
what he had to say. The idea came to me that he
might make restitution in some way without handing
all the fortune over to John&mdash;anyhow, it would be
doing something, and I determined to use all my knowledge
and power if necessary.</p>

<p>Ever been to Oakslot? It is the quaintest and
quietest place, and it wasn’t till I got out of the train
and found myself on the platform that the terrible
nature of the business I was on took me by the arm.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in finding Alexander Abbott’s
residence; the Waterings was the name it went by,
an old Georgian house set in a small park; one of those
small, rook-haunted, sleepy, sunlit pleasaunces found
only in England and best in Sussex or Kent.</p>

<p>I was shown into the drawing-room by an old manservant,
who took my card, on which I had pencilled:
“From Captain Richard Abbott.”</p>

<p>A few moments passed and the door opened and a
girl came in, a girl of sixteen or so, pretty as a picture
and charming as a rose; one of those sweet, whole,
fresh, candid creatures, almost sexless as yet, but made
to love and be loved.</p>

<p>I stood before her. I was Tragedy, but she only
saw a man. She told me her father was unwell but
would see me. Would I follow her?</p>

<p>She led me to a library, and there, seated by the
window which gave upon the sunlit park, sat the
criminal, a man of forty or so, a man with seemingly a
good and kindly face, a man I would have trusted on
sight. He was evidently far gone in consumption, this
forger of documents, and it was pretty evident that
anxiety had helped in the business; a weight on the
conscience is a big handicap if one is trying to fight
disease.</p>

<p>I sat down near him and started right in; the quicker
you get a surgical operation over the better, and so
he seemed to think, for when I told him of the finding
of the notice and went on to say that it might be
necessary to inquire into the will and that I had
reason to believe there was something wrong about
it, he saw I knew nearly everything and stopped me
right off.</p>

<p>“Everything is wrong about it,” said he, “and
thank God that this matter has fallen into the hands
of a straight and honest man like you&mdash;you will
understand. This thing has tormented me for years,
but when you have heard what I have to say you
will know I did wrong only to do right. There is no
greater scoundrel in this world than my brother
John Abbott; a terrible thing to say but the truth.
My father had made a will leaving him everything.
He placed that will in the hands of James Anderson
of Sydney, our lawyer. Anderson knew John’s
character better than my father and was averse
from the business, but he could do nothing. My
father was a very headstrong man and blind to John’s
doings, which the scamp somehow managed to partly
conceal from him. He thought John was sowing his
wild oats and that he would be all the better for it.
John could do no wrong in his eyes, but a few days
before his death he had a terrible awakening with a
forged bill of exchange&mdash;forgery seems to run in
the family. It cost him five thousand pounds to stifle
the matter, and the day after the business was settled
my father died; slipped coming downstairs, fell, and
broke his back.</p>

<p>“I was there and he died in my arms, and his last
words were: ‘Get that will from Anderson and
destroy it.’ He had no power to write a new will, no
strength even to write his signature, and when he was
dead there was I with those words ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>“I knew my father intended to revoke his first will,
would have done it that day; maybe, ought to have
done it days ago, but his mind was in a turmoil and
he was a strong, hearty man with never a thought
of death. Well, there I was, not only with that
knowledge but the knowledge that if the property fell
to John it would be the end of the family’s good name;
that beast was only possible when he was kept short
of money&mdash;then there was the lower consideration of
my own position, penniless and at John’s mercy.</p>

<p>“I made a will and put my father’s name to it,
sure that Anderson would make no trouble, sure
that John would not inquire into it, for the forgery
of the bill of exchange had drawn his teeth, and the
fact of that forgery would account to him for the
change in the disposition of the property.</p>

<p>“I dated the will, it is true, some years back, and
in the time my father lived in Sydney. I did that
because I had to forge the names of the two witnesses;
had I dated it recently someone might ask who are
these witnesses? As it was there was no one to put
that question to, for I was not in Sydney at the time
indicated in the will&mdash;they might have been hotel
servants&mdash;anyone.</p>

<p>“I left myself the whole property, not from greed
but simply because my brother Richard was at sea.
I knew his temperament and character, and it was
possible that, had I made him part heir, he would
have revolted and disclosed all&mdash;for I had determined
to tell him everything.</p>

<p>“I placed the forged will among my father’s papers;
it was proved and there was no trouble. Anderson,
whose clients are largely wool brokers and Australian
merchants, has a branch office in London; they were
my father’s solicitors in England as well as Australia,
and the whole thing went through their hands. They
had all the less reason to cast any suspicious eye on
the document in as much as they had dealt with the
forgery of the bill of exchange.</p>

<p>“Then Richard came back from sea and I told him
all. He was horrified, yet he saw that what I had
done had been simply to carry out my father’s wish.
It was impossible to destroy the old will as he had
directed, or possible only in one way&mdash;by the creation
of a new will.</p>

<p>“After a while he cooled on the matter and even
accepted a large sum for the purchase of a ship, the
<i>Shanghai</i>, now lost. But the thing weighed on his
mind as it has on mine, only more so. He was of a
different temperament. He did not dread detection,
with him it was entirely a matter of conscience: he
felt he had defrauded John by being partner to the
business, and accepting that sum of money. He
seemed to think in his sailor way it would bring him
bad luck; no doubt when the end came and he lost his
ship he had that in mind, and lest the bad luck might
follow him into the next world wrote that notice you
found. I have only a few more months to live&mdash;now
tell me, was I right or wrong in doing what I did?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “I am not your judge,
but all I can say is this: from what I know of the
business, I will move no further in the matter, if for
no other reason than that, should John Abbott get
word of the business, your daughter would be rendered
penniless after your death.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” said he.</p>

<p>I asked him was John receiving an allowance, and
he said yes. He was receiving two pounds a week
for life.</p>

<p>Then I left him and took the train for London, and
from that day to this I have heard nothing of any of
the lot of them. I expect he’s dead and his daughter
an heiress&mdash;I don’t know, but I’ll never touch a thing
like that again. Even still I’m bothered to know if I
was right or wrong in holding my hand and tongue.
What would you have done in similar circumstances?</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
